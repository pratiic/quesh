feathers everywhere, my darling.

Get to it, Fletcher.
I'm starting to itch.

00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:08,170
Now, we both know that your boss has
very, very deep pockets,

79
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:11,340
and I would like to invite him just
to have a teeny rummage in them.

are you talking about?

recordings, the lot,

85

that much on a bottle of scotch.

demonstrate why my quote is my quote.

to imagine a character,

old-school cinema format.

anamorphic, or ratio 2.35 to 1.

00:10:37,872 --> 00:10:41,243
Yes, Raymond, I do know about
the Jewish billionaire cowboy,

171
00:10:41,376 --> 00:10:44,446
another slice of Americana
creating drama in <i>Angleterre.</i>

172
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:48,583
And finally to Matthew Berger
blindsiding us with his donation

173
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:51,886
to build the entire cognitive
behavioral therapy unit.

174
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:54,724
[Fletcher] <i>So these two have met before.
Fuck knows where.</i>

175
00:10:54,856 --> 00:10:58,793
<i>Presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in Las Vegas.</i>

176
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,996
<i>And they've done
some small deals together,</i>

177
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,465
<i>but now they're ready
for the big one.</i>

178
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:06,368
Well, that was unexpected,
Matthew.

179
00:11:07,068 --> 00:11:09,304
Now I understand why you're
seated at the head of the table.

180
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:12,073
Snuck that one right by me, didn't
you, you naughty little girl?

181
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,476
Making a splash
with the gentry.

182
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:17,178
Oh, I like to make a splash
whenever possible.

183
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:21,449
Well, you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire.

184
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,984
Indeed I do.

185
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:24,419
I believe
a sense of ownership

186
00:11:24,552 --> 00:11:26,254
is vital
in every aspect of life,

187
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:28,758
perhaps never more so than
when it comes to wardrobe.

188
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,594
For every look there is a season,
and for every season a strategy.

189
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:35,130
[Fletcher]
<i>Now starts the alpha dance.</i>

190
00:11:35,263 --> 00:11:36,898
<i>They're not really talking
about clothes, Raymond.</i>

191
00:11:37,032 --> 00:11:38,634
<i>Oh, fucking no.</i>

192
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,435
<i>They're like
a pair of old doggies</i>

193
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:43,004
<i>sniffing round one another's
intellectual assholes.</i>

194
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:45,807
<i>It's a good old-fashioned
cock-off, Raymond.</i>

195
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,644
Michael, I'm looking forward
to doing business together.

196
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:51,613
- May we excuse ourselves?
- Yes, please.

197
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:54,349
We should say good night
to our host.

198
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:00,588
So what do you think?

199
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:02,692
I'm not sure.

200
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:03,825
[Matthew] Your Grace.

201
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,360
[woman] He's a fox,

202
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:07,162
and foxes
have a predictable nature.

203
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,064
Trust this Jew
about that Jew.

204
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:10,666
If you let him
in the henhouse,

205
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,668
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere.

206
00:12:13,803 --> 00:12:16,304
Fresh from
a farmyard pheasant shoot,

207
00:12:16,438 --> 00:12:19,174
these two are starting
to like each other.

208
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:21,843
It's looking good, Ray.
It's looking fucking good.

209
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:24,579
- [gunshot]
- I'm impressed with what you've done with your enterprise.

210
00:12:24,714 --> 00:12:26,848
You see, try as I might,
I can't work out how you do it,

211
00:12:26,981 --> 00:12:28,751
and bush is my game.

212
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:31,386
How does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk

213
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,421
without letting anyone else
know how they do it?

214
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:35,957
I'm flattered to hear that
from you, Matthew.

215
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:38,493
I imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears

216
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,195
just trying
to figure it out.

217
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:41,797
Brilliance
should be acknowledged.

218
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,997
Mm.

219
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:44,866
Run the numbers
by me again.

220
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:48,570
200 million gross p.a.,
100 million net.

221
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:50,138
But your people
know this already.

222
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:52,340
They've swept the numbers
for months now.

223
00:12:52,474 --> 00:12:56,378
The bottom line is I'll sell
it to you for 400 million.

224
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:05,286
But you knew that already.
Hop in.

225
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,056
[Fletcher] <i>Now, I can't be specific
about the heroes and zeros,</i>

226
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:10,626
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance.

227
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,262
Question: What would it be
worth to have the power

228
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:16,965
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that?

229
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:21,202
Answer: A greedy man would
want half the sale price,

230
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:24,372
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds

231
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:27,909
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable.

232
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,647
You're a cunning and creative
toad, aren't you, Fletcher,

233
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:33,615
coming up
with a plan like this?

234
00:13:33,749 --> 00:13:35,651
Yeah, but I didn't really
come up with it, did I?

235
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:37,252
It was Big Dave.

236
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:39,020
He commissioned me
to do a job on Mickey,

237
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:40,689
you know, sniff about,
keep an eye on him,

238
00:13:40,823 --> 00:13:42,758
go through his bins,
reveal his sins.

239
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:47,595
Mickey Pearson, the odious Yankee gangster.
We're gonna bury him.

240
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,533
Because it seems he's got himself
a new friend. Lord Pressfield.

241
00:13:51,667 --> 00:13:54,602
Question:
Is that the Lord Pressfield?

242
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,304
<i>His Grace, the duke?</i>

243
00:13:56,438 --> 00:13:59,073
Yeah. Once fourth in line
to the throne.

244
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:00,776
Apparently Mickey Pearson
has squeaked his way

245
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,211
into the crack
of his fat, posh ass.

246
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:07,817
This is yours, Fletcher. I need a man
with your creativity, with your nose.

247
00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:09,652
Now, you know
you're my favorite bloodhound.

248
00:14:09,785 --> 00:14:11,586
I just think it's really
important to remember

249
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,154
who you're talking to, Dave.

250
00:14:13,288 --> 00:14:15,490
Of course I remember,
Fletcher.

251
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:18,526
So just make absolutely sure the
check doesn't disappoint this time.

252
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:21,329
The number is 150,000.

253
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:24,365
He wants to ruin him,

254
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:27,435
but I am here
to do you a favor.

255
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:31,339
And it's not like you're not
getting something for your money.

256
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:34,609
You could even turn that script
into a feature film, Raymond.

257
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:38,379
We could make it together.
We could be partners.

258
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,850
I have learned off you lot.

259
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:44,586
You gotta look after number
one, and now it's my turn.

260
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:49,491
The sun is not going up
for me, Ray. It's going down.

261
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:53,929
So why has Big Dave
got it in for my boss?

262
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:56,097
Two months ago,
your man Mickey

263
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:58,834
<i>made my man Dave feel
like a right fucking idiot.</i>

264
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:00,836
Henry. Mickey.

265
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,103
How did he do that?

266
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:03,605
Didn't accept his hand.

267
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:05,708
- Dave. <i>Daily Print.</i>
- Yes.

268
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:08,644
No. Editor
of the <i>Daily Print.</i>

269
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:11,546
[Fletcher] <i>Turns out Dave had
gone after one of Mickey's lords,</i>

270
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,581
<i>did a proper tabloid job
on him.</i>

271
00:15:13,716 --> 00:15:15,885
<i>It would appear that His
Lordship had had a quick spin</i>

272
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:18,253
<i>on one of
his attractive young footmen.</i>

273
00:15:18,386 --> 00:15:20,990
<i>After the splash, shares
crashed, job went, wife followed,</i>

274
00:15:21,122 --> 00:15:23,191
<i>and even his kids
disowned him.</i>

275
00:15:23,324 --> 00:15:25,628
<i>Well, that Dave
can't half be a cunt.</i>

276
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:28,162
But no one
will pull him on it.

277
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:30,598
Too fucking scared that Dave
will do a feature on them.

278
00:15:30,733 --> 00:15:33,535
<i>But your Mickey, he's got
a fabulous set of balls.</i>

279
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:36,839
So he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that Dave could only wish he belonged to.

280
00:15:36,972 --> 00:15:40,208
You know, lords and ladies, the sort that
Mickey feels very comfortable in front of.

281
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,978
Men, excuse us.

282
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:45,146
[Fletcher] <i>Well, he might just as
well have pulled Dave's cock off.</i>

283
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,016
I do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off, Dave. [laughs]

284
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:49,117
[Fletcher] <i>'Cause he just
fizzled like a party balloon.</i>

285
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:51,854
That's no reason
to go after a fella.

286
00:15:51,987 --> 00:15:54,657
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
He wants Mickey's blood.

287
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,259
And he would be getting it
too, if it wasn't for...

288
00:15:59,294 --> 00:16:02,731
You're a filthy fantasist,
and now it's time to leave.

289
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:06,167
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm only just lubing you up.

290
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:11,172
Now, there is a reason why Matthew,
or anyone else for that matter,

291
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:14,275
cannot work out
how Mickey does what he does.

292
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:18,212
How does he grow 50 tons of white
widow super cheese every year?

293
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:20,248
Everyone knows
that needs a lot of space.

294
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:23,786
So where is the space and how
come he's kept it under wraps?

295
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,088
<i>You can't just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there.</i>

296
00:16:27,221 --> 00:16:28,791
<i>Oh, no, my love.
That will not work.</i>

297
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:32,728
No. You have to be creative.
You need an angle.

298
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:35,664
The problem with land in this
country is there's not much of it...

299
00:16:37,032 --> 00:16:39,969
and there's public access even
when it's supposed to be private.

300
00:16:40,535 --> 00:16:43,438
And the public have rights:
dog walkers...

301
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:45,239
- [horn honks]
- Yes, jog on.

302
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,810
<i>...footpaths, right to roam,</i>

303
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:49,410
<i>bimblers, ramblers,</i>

304
00:16:49,544 --> 00:16:50,980
- <i>badger lovers...</i>
- [squeaks]

305
00:16:51,714 --> 00:16:53,649
<i>...and any other busy cunt
with enough time on his hands</i>

306
00:16:53,782 --> 00:16:55,116
to sniff
the green tweed of England.

307
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:56,752
- [man] Good morning!
- [dog barking]

308
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,386
And they have groups,

309
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,057
<i>forums, meetings,
social media,</i>

310
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,059
<i>and they love
a good chat and a hiss</i>

311
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:06,895
about anyone who's decided to
mow his lawn without a license.

312
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,299
And then there's the helicopters,
drones, Google Earth,

313
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:13,501
<i>heritage sites,
parish councils,</i>

314
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:15,004
and the beat goes on.

315
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:18,272
And that's before you even think
about getting power in here.

316
00:17:20,643 --> 00:17:23,679
[Fletcher] So what is
Mickey's unique method?

317
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:28,316
I tip my cap at the cheek,
at the elegance, at the class.

318
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:31,053
And what would
that method be exactly?

319
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:33,521
You have to understand
a culture to understand a man.

320
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:36,025
<i>Toffs, aristocrats,</i>

321
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:39,128
<i>dukes, duchesses,
lords and ladies,</i>

322
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,130
lots of land
and fuck all dough.

323
00:17:41,262 --> 00:17:45,034
<i>Houses to keep, damp to
keep out, silver to polish.</i>

324
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,169
You must remember
that cash is very persuasive

325
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:51,707
<i>to the class that got spanked by
angry lefties and death duties.</i>

326
00:17:52,975 --> 00:17:56,544
<i>And every time you inherit a
fortune, you lose half to the state.</i>

327
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,681
- [slurps]
- <i>So this is my moment to swoop in</i>

328
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:00,849
<i>like a guardian fucking angel</i>

329
00:18:00,983 --> 00:18:04,385
<i>and offer my services so they
can keep their houses in order.</i>

330
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:06,655
And they're not too bothered
about what I do,

331
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:10,224
<i>as long as that cash
keeps rolling in each year.</i>

332
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:13,128
It's good to get a lord, yes,
but it's not easy.

333
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:17,066
It takes work,
wine, women and disco.

334
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,401
<i>Twelve sites. Twelve farms.</i>

335
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:23,438
<i>One thousand of these estates
in the great UK.</i>

336
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:25,573
<i>Bonne chance</i>
trying to find them all.

337
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:29,778
That's it. My infrastructure.

338
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:35,349
And that, sir, is, with my
blessing, what you are paying for.

339
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,787
If it's as discreet and as
lucrative as you claim it is,

340
00:18:38,921 --> 00:18:40,621
I'll buy the whole business.

341
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:42,590
But enough foreplay, Michael.

342
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:44,592
I wanna see your plant.

343
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,762
[engine stops]

344
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:48,997
I've gone to great lengths
to make my operation

345
00:18:49,131 --> 00:18:51,667
as invisible as possible,
Matthew.

346
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,235
If you were standing on my
bush, you wouldn't know it.

347
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,842
As a matter of fact,
you are standing on my bush.

348
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:04,847
It's a spectacular business,
Michael.

349
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:07,716
Such a shame it will go
bankrupt in ten years

350
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,952
when things go legal
in the great UK.

351
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:12,921
And you want me
to pay top dollar for it?

352
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:15,256
A nugget under half a yard?

353
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:17,726
That is the price.

354
00:19:18,727 --> 00:19:21,496
Now step inside and I'll show
you what half a yard gets you.

355
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:31,006
Ooh. A delightful tool shed
for 400 million dollars.

356
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,441
Is the ball-peen hammer
included?

357
00:19:33,574 --> 00:19:36,477
Course it is.
Now let me show you the nails.

358
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:45,586
Watch your head.

359
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,656
Carry on, chaps.

360
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:01,170
England's
green and pleasant land.

361
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:04,773
Those are some nails.

362
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:09,178
Location, staff, technology.

363
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:13,949
See, you're buying the substructure
for the superstructure to come,

364
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:18,253
and with purchase you will
inherit the best sites available,

365
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:21,489
the finest botanists and herb
sommeliers in the world,

366
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:25,194
as well as the most innovative
marijuana technology on the planet.

367
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,897
And when this little piggy
goes to legal market

368
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:32,067
and the demand
way outpaces the supply...

369
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:36,470
these locations,
these green-fingered botanical boys,

370
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:38,907
as well as
my superior technology,

371
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,341
will be at a premium.

372
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:43,178
And you would own them all.

373
00:20:46,014 --> 00:20:50,052
Did you know it took 15 years after
alcohol prohibition ended back home

374
00:20:50,185 --> 00:20:52,321
for the legal market
to scratch that itch?

375
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,890
Fifteen years.

376
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,592
And that's if
you do nothing with it.

377
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:01,029
Yes, it's a win-win,
no matter how you look at it.

378
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:04,867
And I'm not greedy.
You and I both know

379
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,203
that 400 million is a
fair-to-generous asking price,

380
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:11,472
especially considering
that once this game's kosher,

381
00:21:11,606 --> 00:21:14,408
it's going to be worth
somewhere between 200 billion

382
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:17,846
and, well,
half a trillion pounds.

383
00:21:18,213 --> 00:21:19,380
Annually.

384
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:21,415
Weed.

385
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:22,751
Bush.

386
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:24,853
Skunk-amola.

387
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:27,756
White widow super cheese.

388
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,224
[chuckles]

389
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:30,726
It's the new gold rush.

390
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:34,863
This is the thin end
of a very fat wedge, sir.

391
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:38,532
If it's such a fat wedge,
why don't you keep it?

392
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,872
You see, I've developed a reputation
as a man who came up the hard way.

393
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:47,843
You could say that there's blood
on these pretty white hands.

394
00:21:48,844 --> 00:21:52,781
But in the new business,
once legal and under the jurisdiction

395
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:56,919
of the respectable umbrella
of ministerial legitimacy,

396
00:21:57,052 --> 00:22:00,722
an enterprise like this will
need a face with a clean past,

397
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:04,059
which sadly I do not possess.

398
00:22:04,192 --> 00:22:06,295
Retirement
doesn't sound so bad.

399
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:09,865
Long walks in the countryside,
pruning roses with my better half,

400
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:11,432
raising some cubs.

401
00:22:11,565 --> 00:22:14,136
[inhales] I've earned it.

402
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,807
Look, we both know growing
is only 50% of the business.

403
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:21,575
I need
your European connections.

404
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,912
I've seen
how the sausage is made.

405
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:25,546
Now tell me
about the butcher shops.

406
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,183
Well, that comes later,
Matthew,

407
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,584
when the money's in escrow.

408
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:34,022
Now that we've established
the dilemma of our protagonist,

409
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:37,693
let us turn to our antagonist.

410
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:40,696
Many miles away,
across the open plains,

411
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:46,201
another beautiful feral beast
lopes his way to a watering hole.

412
00:22:46,335 --> 00:22:47,601
Who are you talking about
now?

413
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:51,539
I talk, Raymondo, of Dry Eye.

414
00:22:51,673 --> 00:22:53,175
Oh, Dry Eye.

415
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:56,044
What is he?
Chinese? Japanese? Pekingese?

416
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:57,545
Get on your fucking knees?

00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:53,548
Looks like
the deal's gone through.

500
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,585
- Second thoughts?
- No second thoughts.

501
00:26:56,718 --> 00:26:58,386
I like middle age.

502
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,890
I like gentrification,
private schools, fine wines

503
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:05,760
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down.

504
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:09,998
But most importantly, I'm looking
forward to spending more time with you.

505
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:11,199
Course you are.

506
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,602
Look, I don't want you
knocking around here

507
00:27:13,735 --> 00:27:16,037
feeling all unemployed
and lost with yourself.

508
00:27:16,538 --> 00:27:17,939
Well, fuck me.

509
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:20,242
Most wives would beg
their other halves

510
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:22,177
to get out
of this game, but not you.

511
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,778
That's because
I know you, darling.

512
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:28,016
Look, you'll have to
do this elegantly, love.

513
00:27:28,684 --> 00:27:32,120
If word spreads that you're getting
out, that could read as weakness.

514
00:27:32,254 --> 00:27:34,422
And if you smell smoke,
it's 'cause there's a fire,

515
00:27:34,556 --> 00:27:36,726
and that could
get expensive.

516
00:27:36,858 --> 00:27:39,761
So you're gonna have to stamp that
out without any gentrification.

517
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:41,796
But not you, love.

518
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:45,333
Don't you do anything messy.

519
00:27:46,134 --> 00:27:48,403
That's why you've
got people, remember?

520
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:50,572
[groans]
I fucking love you, babe.

521
00:27:50,706 --> 00:27:52,073
Course you do.

522
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,175
Any chance?

523
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,579
No, you can wait.

524
00:27:58,013 --> 00:28:00,248
I've got a red-hot Russki
with her finger on the trigger.

525
00:28:00,382 --> 00:28:03,018
- Gotta deal with it.
- I don't mind the two of yous.

526
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:04,853
Go on, fuck off.

527
00:28:06,788 --> 00:28:07,989
Fletcher...

528
00:28:09,424 --> 00:28:11,059
why are you
wasting our time?

529
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:14,062
I know what happens in my
world and what doesn't.

530
00:28:14,195 --> 00:28:17,299
What I fail to recognize is
why Michael should be motivated

531
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:19,167
to write you
a check for 20 million.

532
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:22,971
I find you very impatient, Raymond.
I am a storyteller.

533
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:25,573
As they say in the film game,
I'm laying pipe.

534
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,777
Well, you'd better put
something through it soon.

535
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:30,312
So what is that?
Is that a barbecue as well?

536
00:28:32,113 --> 00:28:34,983
- Yes, it is, Fletcher.
- I love a barbie.

537
00:28:35,383 --> 00:28:37,152
That is a useful bit of plant,
then, isn't it?

538
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:40,055
So that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time?

539
00:28:40,188 --> 00:28:42,891
[chuckles] You gotta show me
how to get one of them.

540
00:28:43,024 --> 00:28:45,327
Well, you can take it with
you if you fuck off now.

541
00:28:46,494 --> 00:28:47,797
Ray.

542
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:50,332
Is there any chance
of a steak?

543
00:28:56,271 --> 00:29:00,041
Yeah, all right. Got a bit of
Wagyu in the freezer as it happens.

544
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:03,646
- I've never had Wagyu.
- Yeah, well, it'll be wasted on you, but it's all I've got.

545
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,715
- I'll get it, mate.
- Oh, no, you're all right.

546
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,750
- Just stay right there.
- Oh.

547
00:29:10,218 --> 00:29:11,386
Ow, fuck me!

548
00:29:12,854 --> 00:29:13,955
It's hot.

549
00:29:20,028 --> 00:29:21,396
[exhales]

550
00:29:22,163 --> 00:29:25,200
He's a sly fox,
that Fletcher.

551
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:33,341
Night-night, Aslan.

552
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:35,877
32 LS engines?

553
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:38,546
You got all these parts
on a 40-foot container?

554
00:29:39,514 --> 00:29:40,515
Yeah.

555
00:29:41,349 --> 00:29:42,550
How'd you get
your hands on that?

556
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:46,254
Ask no questions,
hear no lies.

557
00:29:46,722 --> 00:29:47,757
Hence the price.

558
00:29:48,724 --> 00:29:50,760
- So how much?
- Oh, no charge.

559
00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:53,194
Okay, so what's the price?

560
00:29:53,328 --> 00:29:54,529
A meeting with your husband.

561
00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:56,297
[chuckles] Oh, fuck off.

562
00:29:56,431 --> 00:29:57,666
That's not gonna happen.

563
00:29:58,233 --> 00:29:59,601
It's in his interest.

564
00:30:01,837 --> 00:30:06,074
Tell you what, keep the parts.
Consider it a gesture of goodwill.

565
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:09,879
You know
how to get hold of me.

566
00:30:11,546 --> 00:30:13,481
Well, I can't
promise anything.

567
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:16,050
Dry Eye, he got his little
sit-down with Michael, didn't he?

568
00:30:16,918 --> 00:30:20,088
Bold move, that,
coming in heavy,

569
00:30:20,221 --> 00:30:23,525
sanctioned or unsanctioned...

570
00:30:24,526 --> 00:30:27,562
<i>by the dragon head himself,
Lord George.</i>

571
00:30:28,229 --> 00:30:30,465
<i>Well, he's a naughty boy,
that George.</i>

572
00:30:30,866 --> 00:30:33,636
<i>But Dry Eye,
oh, he's next generation,</i>

573
00:30:33,769 --> 00:30:36,938
<i>and them Chinamen, they upgrade
quicker than i-fucking-Phones.</i>

574
00:30:37,071 --> 00:30:38,373
Is he making moves?

575
00:30:38,506 --> 00:30:40,141
[chattering]

576
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:42,110
[Fletcher]
<i>Is he breaking out on his own?</i>

577
00:30:42,243 --> 00:30:44,747
<i>Big man plans
behind Lord George's back?</i>

578
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:51,519
To be fair, it was very nicely played
with 100 grand's worth of free car parts,

579
00:30:51,654 --> 00:30:56,124
because everyone knows that the way
to a man's heart is through his wife.

580
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:00,528
You'd make a lovely wife,
Raymond.

581
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:13,541
Thank you for taking the time
to see me, Michael.

582
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:15,878
Lord George sends his best.

583
00:31:16,311 --> 00:31:19,047
I only took this meeting
because Ros asked me to.

584
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,082
Make sure to never approach
her like that again.

585
00:31:21,717 --> 00:31:23,351
I meant no disrespect.

586
00:31:33,662 --> 00:31:34,763
How can I help?

587
00:31:35,931 --> 00:31:37,298
I understand
you're getting out.

588
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:41,269
Getting out.
Getting out of what?

589
00:31:41,402 --> 00:31:43,505
Bed? My head?
The closet?

590
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:46,140
Don't flirt with me, Dry Eye.
I'm a busy man.

591
00:31:46,742 --> 00:31:48,476
I hear you're
getting out of the game.

592
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:52,915
And I would like you
to consider an offer.

593
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:55,049
Look, I'm gonna stop you
right there

594
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:57,151
so you don't waste any more of
your precious breath, young man.

595
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:59,487
This is not a discussion
for the two of us.

596
00:31:59,621 --> 00:32:01,657
Unlike the salt and pepper,
it's not on the table.

597
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,596
This is a big number.

598
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,101
[typing on phone]

599
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:31,720
Cash.

600
00:32:32,287 --> 00:32:35,758
I am not for sale.

601
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:40,562
And even if I was,
you're several zeros short.

602
00:32:40,696 --> 00:32:42,898
Now, you may be able to buy
your man's sausage for that,

603
00:32:43,032 --> 00:32:45,366
but to me it just looks
rude at breakfast.

604
00:32:48,003 --> 00:32:49,070
You're out of touch.

605
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:55,410
You're forgetting the laws of the
jungle, looking down on me.

606
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:03,585
Now, when the silverback's
got more silver than back...

607
00:33:04,687 --> 00:33:05,955
he best move on...

608
00:33:08,122 --> 00:33:09,591
before he gets moved on.

609
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,293
It's not dignified.

610
00:33:13,094 --> 00:33:16,932
It's beneath you, Michael.
Trying to do you a favor.

611
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:18,266
[sighs]

612
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:21,202
This is a big fucking number.

613
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:28,711
And this?

614
00:33:29,544 --> 00:33:31,279
This is a big fucking gun.

615
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:36,919
[groans]

616
00:33:38,386 --> 00:33:39,454
[squealing]

617
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:41,222
Eyes not so dry now, are they?

618
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:42,992
[screaming]

619
00:33:43,792 --> 00:33:44,927
Hurts, does it?

620
00:33:46,427 --> 00:33:48,631
You looking for your balls
or a hole in the wall?

621
00:33:48,764 --> 00:33:51,432
- Fuck!
- Where the fuck do you think you're going?

622
00:33:51,834 --> 00:33:55,169
Because you're not going out the way you
came in, you deluded duck-eating cunt.

623
00:33:55,303 --> 00:33:57,973
- [screams]
- Talking to me about the laws of the jungle.

624
00:33:58,107 --> 00:34:00,809
What was it? Something
about being beneath me?

625
00:34:00,943 --> 00:34:02,377
Silver on back?

626
00:34:03,578 --> 00:34:06,015
There's only one rule
in this fucking jungle.

627
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:09,484
When the lion's hungry,
he eats.

628
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:12,353
[Raymond]
<i>You're wrong, Fletcher.</i>

629
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:14,155
That's not how Michael works.

630
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:17,325
Yeah, I know. I know. I was
just having a bit of fun.

631
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:19,560
Every movie needs
a bit of action, doesn't it?

632
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:21,630
And it's not like Michael
doesn't have a reputation.

633
00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:23,498
Had a reputation.

634
00:34:24,133 --> 00:34:25,834
He's been gentrified.

635
00:34:26,635 --> 00:34:28,804
[audio rewinding]

636
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:32,675
[Dry Eye]
<i>...big fucking number.</i>

637
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:37,545
I know how you lot love fables,
so let me share a little fable with you.

638
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:41,315
There once was
a young and foolish dragon

639
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,686
who came to ask
a wise and cunning lion

640
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:46,121
about acquiring
his territory.

641
00:34:46,254 --> 00:34:49,190
Now, the lion, he wasn't interested,
so he told the little dragon to fuck off.

642
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:53,062
But the dragon couldn't
understand what "fuck off" meant,

643
00:34:53,194 --> 00:34:56,031
so he persisted and
continued to ask the lion

644
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:58,067
about acquiring
his territory.

645
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:01,003
So the lion took
the little dragon for a walk

646
00:35:01,136 --> 00:35:03,839
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head.

647
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,009
End of story.

648
00:35:09,645 --> 00:35:12,380
Now, allegedly
there's a message in there.

649
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:15,684
I don't know what it is,
but you're a clever boy, Dry Eye.

650
00:35:15,818 --> 00:35:17,585
Maybe you can
explain it to me.

651
00:35:19,587 --> 00:35:21,389
I think your time's up,
chaps.

652
00:35:22,557 --> 00:35:24,727
Michael, you should recons...

653
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,894
[tuts]

654
00:35:27,395 --> 00:35:28,596
Just marinade on it.

655
00:35:30,065 --> 00:35:31,700
In the meantime, fuck off.

656
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:39,373
Oh, I bet Mickey was pleased he
took that meeting, wasn't he?

657
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:41,777
Yes, it went very well.

658
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,946
- Yeah.
- Do you want the top or the bottom?

659
00:35:44,412 --> 00:35:46,048
The bottom, please, darling.

660
00:35:46,882 --> 00:35:49,517
Now, things started to unravel
after that meeting.

661
00:35:49,651 --> 00:35:52,553
Didn't Mickey get a rat
infestation at one of his farms?

662
00:35:58,794 --> 00:35:59,995
[man 1 whispering] Come on.

663
00:36:01,395 --> 00:36:02,463
Stealth, stealth.

664
00:36:03,932 --> 00:36:04,967
Go.

665
00:36:07,236 --> 00:36:08,569
Ballys down.

666
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:13,474
Let's move. Go, go, go, go.

667
00:36:16,277 --> 00:36:17,278
[man 2] Shit.

668

00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,003
<i>Especially to film it all
and then post it all online?</i>

833
00:42:48,136 --> 00:42:51,706
Because that is really rubbing
your face in it, isn't it?

834
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:53,675
[Matthew]
<i>I'm here to help, Michael.</i>

835
00:42:53,808 --> 00:42:56,278
I'm your friend, your ally,

836
00:42:56,411 --> 00:42:58,346
your Santa Claus
for all seasons,

837
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,284
and I'd like you to know my team
of elves can be very persuasive.

838
00:43:02,684 --> 00:43:06,388
Persuasive? And why
would I need persuasive?

839
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:09,891
Well, I hear you might have
had a little trouble.

840
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:12,827
Now, you helped me before
when my source ran dry,

841
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:15,397
so I'm just returning
the favor and reminding you

842
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,098
I have effectual friends.

843
00:43:17,232 --> 00:43:18,500
Elves?

844
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:20,335
Elves?

845
00:43:20,468 --> 00:43:23,238
- Yes. You said elves.
- Did I?

846
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:24,406
Mm.

847
00:43:25,173 --> 00:43:28,678
No trouble over here, Matthew.
No trouble at all.

848
00:43:31,413 --> 00:43:32,814
So we brought you
a token.

849
00:43:32,948 --> 00:43:34,082
[Mickey] You did?

850
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,554
And what might this be?

851
00:43:39,689 --> 00:43:43,091
It's a paperweight to keep down all
the paper I'm about to give you.

852
00:43:43,225 --> 00:43:46,161
- Well, it looks like a gun.
- And it's a paperweight.

853
00:43:46,294 --> 00:43:50,599
Seeing how in this country,
unlike in our homeland, they're illegal.

854
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:53,335
So is riding your bicycle
at night without lights.

855
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:55,070
Laws are there
as a guideline.

856
00:43:55,203 --> 00:43:57,839
In France, it's illegal
to call a pig Napoleon,

857
00:43:57,973 --> 00:43:59,341
but just try and stop me.

858
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:03,511
I quite like it.
You're very kind.

859
00:44:03,646 --> 00:44:06,181
- Thank you.
- Hands across the sea.

860
00:44:06,314 --> 00:44:08,350
[Fletcher]
<i>Mickey calmed down the Jew</i>

861
00:44:08,483 --> 00:44:10,085
<i>and it seems the deal
is still going ahead.</i>

862
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:14,122
<i>But bad timing, jeopardizing
deals, shutting down farms.</i>

863
00:44:14,256 --> 00:44:18,293
<i>It could be an expensive disaster if
Mickey doesn't get this cleaned up.</i>

864
00:44:18,728 --> 00:44:20,495
[man] Should I be scared?

865
00:44:21,796 --> 00:44:25,333
[Mickey] I don't think so,
but I like to err on the side of caution.

866
00:44:25,467 --> 00:44:26,968
What does that mean?

867
00:44:27,102 --> 00:44:28,970
It means I'm going to
have to close shop,

868
00:44:29,104 --> 00:44:32,173
shut this farm down
and make it disappear.

869
00:44:32,607 --> 00:44:34,075
You might see
a couple of trucks around here

870
00:44:34,209 --> 00:44:35,944
over the next few days,
but that's it.

871
00:44:36,077 --> 00:44:38,179
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
that missing out

872
00:44:38,313 --> 00:44:41,349
on a million pounds commission a
year isn't going to hurt somewhat.

873
00:44:41,483 --> 00:44:43,084
The pain is being shared.

874
00:44:43,218 --> 00:44:46,621
Stolen product,
loss of earnings meantime,

875
00:44:46,756 --> 00:44:49,824
the cost of shutting down,
the expense of setting up elsewhere.

876
00:44:50,558 --> 00:44:52,427
It's funny, really, but
it couldn't be worse timing.

877
00:44:52,762 --> 00:44:54,062
How so?

878
00:44:54,195 --> 00:44:55,430
I've...

879
00:44:56,598 --> 00:44:58,900
I've just learned we need
a whole new roof apparently.

880
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:02,337
As I say, I'm as upset
about this as you are.

881
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:09,010
- Henry.
- Mickey.

882
00:45:09,745 --> 00:45:13,581
[Fletcher] <i>The toffs look after Mickey.
Now Mickey looks after the toffs.</i>

883
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:16,786
<i>But there's a lot of toffs
to look after.</i>

884
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:19,621
- Henry.
- [Fletcher] <i>And when it rains...</i>

885
00:45:19,755 --> 00:45:21,156
Let me take care of the roof.

886
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:23,525
[Fletcher]
<i>...it fucking pours.</i>

887
00:45:24,025 --> 00:45:27,062
<i>Now, there's only one thing that
needs more looking after than a toff,</i>

888
00:45:27,195 --> 00:45:29,665
<i>and that is
a toff's offspring.</i>

889
00:45:29,799 --> 00:45:33,068
<i>Which brings me neatly back
to Big Dave's story,</i>

890
00:45:33,201 --> 00:45:35,705
<i>the very reason I'm sitting
here sipping whiskey with you</i>

891
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:37,572
<i>in the first fucking place.</i>

892
00:45:37,707 --> 00:45:41,242
<i>This is how Big Dave
is gonna bring Mickey down,</i>

893
00:45:41,376 --> 00:45:45,547
<i>by using and abusing Lord
Pressfield's much-beloved child.</i>

894
00:45:45,681 --> 00:45:50,485
Lord Pressfield's daughter, the famous and
talented Laura, all self-hate and harm,

895
00:45:50,618 --> 00:45:53,888
has fallen for this Power
Noel's smacked-out dark charm,

896
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:55,691
and I want the lot of them,

897
00:45:56,257 --> 00:45:59,060
especially that
slimy little jam rag Pearson,

898
00:45:59,194 --> 00:46:01,731
in bed with a skint,
discredited toff,

899
00:46:01,863 --> 00:46:05,567
and supplying gear to young
and reckless rock-star royals,

900
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:07,969
royals unbridled
by distracted parents

901
00:46:08,103 --> 00:46:10,171
too busy skiing
on the Swiss Alps to notice

902
00:46:10,305 --> 00:46:12,040
and too fucking stupid
to care.

903
00:46:12,173 --> 00:46:14,876
[chuckles] I like it.
You're good at this, boss.

904
00:46:15,009 --> 00:46:17,011
Yeah, I know what I'm good at,
Hammy. Fuck off.

905
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:22,584
<i>Aristocratic, junkie, bulimic,
auto-tuned singing daughter</i>

906
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:25,253
<i>shacked up with some smacked-out,
once-upon-a-time pop star,</i>

907
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:27,055
<i>and all looked after
by Mickey Pearson.</i>

908
00:46:27,188 --> 00:46:30,191
I like it.
You know, I like it a lot.

909
00:46:30,892 --> 00:46:32,560
We wrapped her
in cotton wool.

910
00:46:32,695 --> 00:46:34,596
But she was
our little Lor-la.

911
00:46:36,131 --> 00:46:39,000
Charlie called her that because
she couldn't say Laura at first.

912
00:46:39,702 --> 00:46:41,403
We miss her terribly, Mickey.

913
00:46:42,504 --> 00:46:44,105
I've failed as a parent.

914
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:46,307
You mustn't keep
beating yourself up, dear.

915
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:49,310
Anne's right, Charles.
You mustn't blame yourselves.

916
00:46:49,444 --> 00:46:51,346
It sounds as though Laura
fell in with the wrong crowd

917
00:46:51,479 --> 00:46:53,948
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable.

918
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:55,684
What more
could we do?

919
00:46:56,918 --> 00:46:58,620
It's happened
to so many of our friends.

920
00:46:58,754 --> 00:47:00,221
It's a curse.

921
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:04,092
- Do you mind if I look into it?
- So you'll help us?

922
00:47:05,728 --> 00:47:07,262
Let me see what I can do.

923
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:13,636
You should get yourself
one of these, boss.

924
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:15,403
Well, that's the plan.

925
00:47:15,537 --> 00:47:17,038
Everything all right?

926
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:18,874
You remember
their daughter?

927
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:20,942
Yeah, Laura.
Nice girl. Good voice.

928
00:47:21,075 --> 00:47:24,612
Teeny sort of spunk-funk fuck pop.
Shame about the habit.

929
00:47:24,747 --> 00:47:28,016
She's gone missing. They've asked
us to find her, bring her home.

930
00:47:28,550 --> 00:47:29,517
Mm-hmm.

931
00:47:30,251 --> 00:47:31,754
Is that a problem?

932
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:33,488
Well, I had a feeling
you might ask me this, boss,

933
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:35,190
so I did some due diligence.

934
00:47:35,323 --> 00:47:37,025
I know where she is
and I don't like it.

935
00:47:37,158 --> 00:47:39,461
- I'd rather we didn't get involved.
- Why not?

936
00:47:39,961 --> 00:47:41,963
[Raymond] <i>She's on
a South London council estate.</i>

937
00:47:42,096 --> 00:47:44,365
- [Mickey] <i>So?</i>
- It's out of our jurisdiction.

938
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:46,802
There's too many moving parts,
parts that we can't control.

939
00:47:46,936 --> 00:47:48,771
What if she doesn't wanna come?
It's gonna get messy.

940
00:47:48,904 --> 00:47:51,606
Well, that may be true,
but you're still doing it.

941
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:53,975
I accept that.

942
00:47:55,143 --> 00:47:56,511
But can't you
send Frazier instead?

943
00:47:56,645 --> 00:47:58,346
No, I can't
send Frazier instead.

944
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,815
You're my best man.
I want you.

945
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:01,349
[sighs]

946
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:07,989
It's just that
I don't like smackies.

947
00:48:08,122 --> 00:48:10,158
It's the filth and the grime
and the grub in the tub.

948
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:13,194
I'm not asking your OCD to spend
the weekend with them, Ray.

949
00:48:14,797 --> 00:48:16,364
Think of it
as philanthropy.

950
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:19,200
Come on,
you're driving.

951
00:48:20,568 --> 00:48:22,537
No good deed
goes unpunished.

952
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:26,742
[chuckles] And this is where you
have your moment, isn't it, Raymondo?

953
00:48:26,876 --> 00:48:28,543
This is where
you step on stage

954
00:48:28,677 --> 00:48:31,012
and set the dominoes flying
every-fucking-where.

955
00:48:32,146 --> 00:48:33,414
Meaning what?

956
00:48:33,548 --> 00:48:37,085
Meaning no good deed
goes unpunished.

957
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:38,888
Knock, knock-knock,
knock, knock.

958
00:48:48,062 --> 00:48:49,364
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

959
00:48:50,198 --> 00:48:51,266
[man] Wrong door.

960
00:48:51,399 --> 00:48:52,567
[Raymond] Ah, ah, ah.

961
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:57,138
My name is Raymond Smith.

962
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:00,174
Can I step inside
for a moment, please?

963
00:49:06,614 --> 00:49:08,149
How can I help you,
Officer?

964
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:12,420
I'm not the police. No, I just
need a moment of your time.

965
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:14,556
It's about Laura Pressfield.

966
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:17,492
I don't know anyone
of that name.

967
00:49:18,293 --> 00:49:20,595
It would be much easier
for all parties concerned

968
00:49:20,729 --> 00:49:22,865
if I could just step inside
for a moment.

969
00:49:23,632 --> 00:49:24,867
No, fuck off.

970
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,835
[boy 1] Jeez.

971
00:49:27,402 --> 00:49:28,871
[boy 2]
That's a nice whip, bruv.

972
00:49:29,337 --> 00:49:31,539
Killer motor. It's a shame
about them rims, though.

973
00:49:31,674 --> 00:49:32,975
[boy 2]
Yeah, lend us the keys.

974
00:49:33,107 --> 00:49:34,944
Put some chrome twenty-twos
on that.

975
00:49:35,076 --> 00:49:37,445
Hey, my man's got the Dessies
and the bootcuts, you know.

976
00:49:37,579 --> 00:49:39,280
Deffo linking a jessie.

[muffled chattering]

979
00:49:54,063 --> 00:49:55,396
[man 1] What the fuck?

980
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,498
[speakers: rock music playing]

[chattering]

982
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:03,438
- [man 1] What are you doing here?
- [man 2] Now, now, now.

983
00:50:04,172 --> 00:50:06,742
- [man 1] Get the fuck out.
- Now, now, now.

[speakers:
music continues playing]

985
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,248
As you was, boys and girls.

986
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,629
Sit down.

987
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,801
Thank you.

988
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:39,607
Shall we have
a little bit of fresh air?

989
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:41,810
[music stops]

990
00:50:44,813 --> 00:50:46,949
Who the fuck
are your mates, Brown?

991
00:50:47,082 --> 00:50:50,786
No need to get excited, young man.
We will be gone in a few moments.

992
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:53,488
No, no, no, you'll be gone before then.
Get the fuck out now.

993
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:58,861
I can be dangerous if I want to be.
Get the fuck out now.

994
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:02,765
Sit down, Power,
before you get yourself into more trouble.

995
00:51:02,898 --> 00:51:05,299
How d'you know my name? How
the fuck does he know my name?

996
00:51:05,433 --> 00:51:07,036
I know all your names.

997
00:51:07,736 --> 00:51:10,973
Apart from
that little anomaly.

998
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,809
I know where
you went to school.

999
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,779
I know who your parents are.

1000
00:51:16,912 --> 00:51:21,449
And I know you'll suck a
cock for a five-pound bag.

1001
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,955
Now sit.

1002
00:51:35,864 --> 00:51:38,867
Just so we're clear,
I work for a man,

1003
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:41,170
a powerful man.

1004
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:42,503
Michael Pearson.

1005
00:51:42,638 --> 00:51:44,205
Ten points to you, Laura.

1006
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:45,674
Who's Michael Pearson?

1007
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:49,210
Friend of her father's.
Runs London's puff game.

1008
00:51:49,343 --> 00:51:50,679
A big dick swinger.

1009
00:51:51,146 --> 00:51:52,513
What is your name,
young man?

1010
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:55,718
- Aslan.
- And where are you from, Aslan?

1011
00:51:55,851 --> 00:51:57,786
You don't sound like
one of the natives.

1012
00:51:58,386 --> 00:51:59,587
Disneyland.

1013
00:51:59,722 --> 00:52:01,289
Sounds about right.

1014
00:52:01,824 --> 00:52:03,558
Well, you are correct.
He is a big dick swinger.

1015
00:52:03,692 --> 00:52:06,028
But I wouldn't want him
to hear you say that.

1016
00:52:06,161 --> 00:52:09,898
It's best you forget what he apparently
does for a living after we depart.

1017
00:52:10,733 --> 00:52:14,103
Now, Laura, your father's
asked us to bring you home.

1018
00:52:14,235 --> 00:52:15,536
She's not going anywhere.

1019
00:52:24,913 --> 00:52:26,181
Do you mind if I sit?

1020
00:52:26,314 --> 00:52:27,548
Yes.

1021
00:52:37,525 --> 00:52:42,765
[sighs] I don't build a joint like
the Americans and the new school...

1022
00:52:43,464 --> 00:52:47,236
back-strapping, jockstrapping,
coke-wrapping, and all that bollocks.

1023
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,739
I like a good old-fashioned
50-50 mix, me.

1024
00:52:51,206 --> 00:52:52,674
That's how we used to play.

1025
00:52:53,274 --> 00:52:55,077
If there's one thing
I will never understand,

1026
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:57,311
it's why you lot
get addicted to heroin.

1027
00:52:57,913 --> 00:53:01,750
If there's one drug you should not
chase, it is the dirty dragon.

1028
00:53:02,651 --> 00:53:04,186
Did you ever
give it a spin, Bunny?

1029
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:07,156
No, not me, Ray.
I don't even puff anymore.

1030
00:53:07,288 --> 00:53:11,325
Of course not. Bunny likes the gym.
You can probably see that.

1031
00:53:12,227 --> 00:53:15,164
- What are you benching these days?
- Three wheels a side.

1032
00:53:16,064 --> 00:53:17,266
What about you, Brown?

1033
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:20,903
What about me?
[stammers] What could I lift?

1034
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:24,273
You couldn't lift
a wheel of cheese, you cunt.

1035
00:53:27,743 --> 00:53:28,977
Now...

1036
00:53:30,879 --> 00:53:32,781
if you wanna be naughty,

1037
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:35,951
what happened to a little smoke
and a poke and a glass of wine,

1038
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:38,319
some Barry White,
candles around the bath

1039
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:39,988
and put your finger
in the missus?

1040
00:53:40,789 --> 00:53:42,224
Who's Barry White?

1041
00:53:42,858 --> 00:53:44,293
[Bunny] Big black geezer.

1042
00:53:44,425 --> 00:53:45,694
Sexy voice.

1043
00:53:45,828 --> 00:53:47,629
I'm... I'm lost.

1044
00:53:47,763 --> 00:53:51,465
Am I in the bath with Barry
White's finger in my missus?

1045
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:55,971
Be quiet, Brown. You were lost
long before Barry White walked in.

1046
00:54:07,883 --> 00:54:09,818
If you lot are unhappy,

1047
00:54:09,952 --> 00:54:12,486
you should share your thoughts
with your friends.

1048
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:16,357
Nice friends. Talk it out,
find a positive solution.

1049
00:54:16,959 --> 00:54:21,029
But, no,
all you lot choose squalor.

1050
00:54:21,997 --> 00:54:24,532
Drowning in
your liberal white guilt.

1051
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,302
Sorry,
what am I guilty of?

1052
00:54:27,435 --> 00:54:29,503
Being a cunt, Brown.

1053
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:32,373
Being a cunt.

1054
00:54:33,842 --> 00:54:35,844
Anyway, I'm not your shrink.

1055
00:54:35,978 --> 00:54:38,180
I'm just trying to radiate
some positive vibes man to man.

1056
00:54:38,313 --> 00:54:40,849
I mean, that's what this puff
game used to be all about.

1057
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:45,687
Anyway...

1058
00:54:47,856 --> 00:54:49,091

Are you ready
to turn the corner?

1062
00:55:01,236 --> 00:55:03,404
Open the curtains
and let the light in?

1063
00:55:03,872 --> 00:55:06,775
Do your mum and dad a favor
and try the impossible,

1064
00:55:07,376 --> 00:55:09,211

1065
00:55:15,516 --> 00:55:16,550
All right.

1066
00:55:17,252 --> 00:55:19,453

That was easy.

1067
00:55:20,588 --> 00:55:22,190
All right, fantastic.

1068
00:55:22,324 --> 00:55:23,926
Well, in that case, Bunny,

1069
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,194
will you help Laura
with her things, please?

1070
00:55:26,328 --> 00:55:28,063
Incoming.

1071
00:55:28,196 --> 00:55:30,098
It's all right, Bunny.
I don't really have anything.

1072
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,273
It's a shithole anyway.

1073
00:55:41,643 --> 00:55:42,978

It's all right, Bunny.
Keep going.

1079
00:55:58,727 --> 00:56:02,097
I just will not be
manhandled by a junkie cunt.

1080

a donkey choker, bruv.

1084

and a packet of sweets.

Oh, but that's not a gun,

No. It was the gravity

to invest in some parachutes.

1330
01:08:26,474 --> 01:08:28,177
There's a pattern
emerging here.

1331
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:29,678
I'm sorry, boss.

1332
01:08:29,812 --> 01:08:31,914
And who's this
jumping Phuc boy, anyway?

1333
01:08:32,047 --> 01:08:34,549
- It's Dry Eye's man.
- You mean Lord George's man.

1334
01:08:35,084 --> 01:08:38,619
It could just be Dry Eye's doing.
He's been getting bold lately.

1335
01:08:38,754 --> 01:08:42,091
Yeah. Well,
they still all work for Lord George.

1336
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:44,993
I'm gonna take care
of this one myself.

1337
01:08:45,127 --> 01:08:47,062
- [sizzling]
- [dishes clanking]

1338
01:08:47,196 --> 01:08:49,230
[people chattering in Chinese]

1339
01:08:59,174 --> 01:09:01,710
[announcer speaking Chinese]

1340
01:09:03,846 --> 01:09:05,681
[announcer
continues in Chinese]

1341
01:09:05,814 --> 01:09:07,515
- [door opens]
- [chimes jingle]

1342
01:09:13,055 --> 01:09:14,156
Lord George.

1343
01:09:14,757 --> 01:09:16,125
Mr. Pearson.

1344
01:09:17,592 --> 01:09:19,094
And to what do I owe?

1345
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,171
[sighs]

1346
01:09:30,939 --> 01:09:32,007
What you watching?

1347
01:09:33,307 --> 01:09:34,810
I'm watching the telly.

1348
01:09:35,376 --> 01:09:37,112
What you watching
on the telly?

1349
01:09:37,246 --> 01:09:39,748
I'm watching
the horse racing.

1350
01:09:40,215 --> 01:09:43,652
Live satellite
from Hong Kong.

1351
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:46,221
My only vice.

1352
01:09:46,354 --> 01:09:48,724
Well, that's not
strictly true, is it?

1353
01:09:49,224 --> 01:09:50,893
Meaning?

1354
01:09:51,026 --> 01:09:54,495
Meaning I've always taken vice
to be the definition

1355
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:57,598
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior

1356
01:09:57,733 --> 01:10:00,501
involving prostitution,
pornography or drugs,

1357
01:10:00,636 --> 01:10:02,905
so, no...

1358
01:10:03,972 --> 01:10:07,276
racing is definitely not
your only vice, your lordship.

1359
01:10:07,408 --> 01:10:10,344
I'd say you're eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man.

1360
01:10:10,478 --> 01:10:12,580
- There is a difference.
- Being?

1361
01:10:13,215 --> 01:10:19,554
I facilitate. I don't participate
in any of the aforementioned vices.

1362
01:10:22,124 --> 01:10:23,225
What about tea?

1363
01:10:32,701 --> 01:10:33,869
[sighs]

1364
01:10:34,002 --> 01:10:35,369
What about tea?

1365
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:38,640
Well, that too is a vice.

1366
01:10:39,641 --> 01:10:41,509
Caffeine is a drug,
don't you know?

1367
01:10:41,643 --> 01:10:45,479
So is that what you're here
to talk to me about? Tea?

1368
01:10:45,613 --> 01:10:49,417
Sweet Mary Jane is my vice
of choice, as you well know.

1369
01:10:49,852 --> 01:10:53,121
Of course, I'm addicted to
selling it, not consuming it.

1370
01:10:53,487 --> 01:10:56,725
I specifically chose
to deal in marijuana.

1371
01:10:57,159 --> 01:10:59,061
Sure, I could see
there was more to be made

1372
01:10:59,194 --> 01:11:02,798
in shifting the white or the brown
powder, as you so chose,

1373
01:11:02,931 --> 01:11:07,468
but, you see, my jam,
it doesn't kill anyone,

1374
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:09,570
and I like that.

1375
01:11:11,974 --> 01:11:13,642
<i>While your poison...</i>

1376
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:19,447
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds.

1377
01:11:27,656 --> 01:11:32,728
So, yes, your facilitation is
most definitely participation.

1378
01:11:42,905 --> 01:11:45,941
But I'm not here to give you a
sermon on situational ethics.

1379
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:49,344
So why the fuck
are you here?

1380
01:11:49,477 --> 01:11:50,779
[stomach gurgling]

1381
01:11:53,315 --> 01:11:54,615
[gags]

1382
01:11:56,218 --> 01:11:57,252
[groans]

1383
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,596
You're starting a war
with me, George,

1384
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,431
and I'm trying to moonwalk
with elegance here,

1385
01:12:10,564 --> 01:12:12,466
but I'm finding it
very fucking difficult.

1386
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,136
[Lord Pressfield] Laura!

1387
01:12:14,269 --> 01:12:15,938
[Lord George]
<i>I don't fuck around with puff.</i>

1388
01:12:16,071 --> 01:12:18,106
You send your man Dry Eye
around my place

1389
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,075
to see if he can buy
my business for a few beans.

1390
01:12:20,208 --> 01:12:21,276
Laura!

1391
01:12:23,477 --> 01:12:25,347
[Mickey] <i>You didn't
think I'd find out?</i>

1392
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:27,349
Having me followed
for months?

1393
01:12:28,616 --> 01:12:30,919
- [Lord George choking]
- Yeah. You crossed the line,

1394
01:12:31,053 --> 01:12:32,620
<i>and that comes
with a price.</i>

1395
01:12:33,221 --> 01:12:35,157
You raided
one of my locations.

1396
01:12:35,891 --> 01:12:37,659
You know the rules,
George.

1397
01:12:38,459 --> 01:12:39,962
What the fuck
were you thinking?

1398
01:12:40,095 --> 01:12:41,930
You raided one of
my locations.

1399
01:12:42,064 --> 01:12:43,932
<i>What the fuck
were you thinking?</i>

1400
01:12:44,299 --> 01:12:46,335
What the fuck
were you thinking, George?

1401
01:12:57,478 --> 01:12:58,512
[exhales]

1402
01:13:00,082 --> 01:13:02,451
[sobbing]

1403
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:13,128
[breathing heavily]

1404
01:13:13,261 --> 01:13:14,663
[exhales]

1405
01:13:15,596 --> 01:13:18,300
[Lord George chokes, gasps]

1406
01:13:22,603 --> 01:13:25,707
Should you
try and undermine me,

1407
01:13:26,441 --> 01:13:29,177
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again,

1408
01:13:29,311 --> 01:13:31,913
I will be forced to accept
your call to arms.

1409
01:13:32,047 --> 01:13:33,248
Do you understand?

1410
01:13:33,382 --> 01:13:34,916
[breathing heavily]

1411
01:13:35,717 --> 01:13:36,818
Good.

1412
01:13:38,186 --> 01:13:41,857
Now, I can see you're feeling
somewhat under the weather.

1413
01:13:42,357 --> 01:13:44,059
<i>That's because
I spiked your tea</i>

1414
01:13:44,192 --> 01:13:46,995
<i>with a nasty little parasitic
genus called shigella.</i>

1415
01:13:47,829 --> 01:13:51,333
Left unattended, you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set.

1416
01:13:53,101 --> 01:13:55,070
I suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits.

1417
01:13:57,538 --> 01:13:59,241
You'll be fine
in an hour or two,

1418
01:13:59,841 --> 01:14:02,144
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions.

1419
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:11,753
And, George, if I can get to
you in your own kitchen...

1420
01:14:13,388 --> 01:14:14,489
I can get to you anywhere.

1421
01:14:22,697 --> 01:14:25,367
- Did you do it?
- Do what?

1422
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,969
Did you raid
Mickey Pearson's farm?

1423
01:14:28,103 --> 01:14:32,207
- No.
- So you're telling me that Phuc did this behind your back.

1424
01:14:33,075 --> 01:14:35,844
Well, let's just say this.
He didn't do it in front of it.

1425
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:37,712
He did it
without my blessing.

1426
01:14:37,846 --> 01:14:39,414
But you did go behind my back

1427
01:14:39,548 --> 01:14:41,316
and offer to buy his business.

1428
01:14:43,351 --> 01:14:45,987
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1429
01:14:48,423 --> 01:14:50,659
Now, let me warn you
the way you warn me.

1430
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:55,464
There comes a point where
the young succeed the old.

1431
01:14:56,565 --> 01:14:57,732
Don't push me.

1432
01:15:02,237 --> 01:15:03,872
There are some things
I don't know about.

1433
01:15:04,005 --> 01:15:07,109
Something between Dry Eye
and Lord George.

1434
01:15:07,242 --> 01:15:12,547
Now, whatever it was,
someone killed Lord George.

1435
01:15:13,014 --> 01:15:17,452
Anyone else might think
that was you or Mickey.

1436
01:15:19,921 --> 01:15:22,057
Shall we continue
with our little story?

1437
01:15:23,725 --> 01:15:25,794
Does that arouse
your interest, Raymond?

1438
01:15:26,428 --> 01:15:27,929
[Raymond]
So Matthew knows Dry Eye.

1439
01:15:29,264 --> 01:15:31,299
- So what?
- Well, yes, I agree.

1440
01:15:31,433 --> 01:15:32,801
Perhaps they were
just meeting up

1441
01:15:32,934 --> 01:15:34,536
to talk about holidaying
in the Maldives

1442
01:15:34,669 --> 01:15:38,507
or the long-term implications
of leaving the EU.

1443
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,512
But I filmed it, had it lip-read,
translated and transcribed.

1444
01:15:43,645 --> 01:15:46,615
Rather like the classic
1974 film <i>The Conversation,</i>

1445
01:15:46,748 --> 01:15:49,117
starring Gene Hackman
and John Cazale.

1446
01:15:49,251 --> 01:15:52,554
You know, Coppola slipped that
one out between the <i>Godfathers.</i>

1447
01:15:53,121 --> 01:15:55,457
It wasn't really for me.
It's a bit boring, to be honest.

1448
01:15:55,590 --> 01:16:00,595
Now, can I just say, that Matthew,
he's quite something, isn't he?

1449
01:16:00,729 --> 01:16:02,697
He's not
your average American.

1450
01:16:02,831 --> 01:16:06,134
He's a Mr. International.
Even speaks a bit of Cantonese.

1451
01:16:06,268 --> 01:16:11,641
Come here. You play Dry Eye
and I shall be Matthew.

1452
01:16:13,241 --> 01:16:14,442
Come on.

1453
01:16:19,114 --> 01:16:21,883
All right. [sighs]

1454
01:16:23,118 --> 01:16:24,786
Try and get it in time
with his lips, all right?

1455
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,521
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ready?

1456
01:16:27,622 --> 01:16:28,823
Roll camera. Action.

1457
01:16:28,957 --> 01:16:30,825
[crowd cheering]

1458
01:16:37,332 --> 01:16:39,501
[camera beeps, clicks]

1459
01:16:39,635 --> 01:16:42,037
[muffled chattering]

1460
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:44,539
[Raymond] <i>There was an incident.
Lord George...</i>

1461
01:16:44,674 --> 01:16:45,774
[Fletcher]
<i>Fuck's sake, Raymond.</i>

1462
01:16:45,907 --> 01:16:47,442
It's a bit fucking wooden.

1463
01:16:47,576 --> 01:16:49,444
Put something into it,
you know, a bit of welly.

1464
01:16:49,978 --> 01:16:51,413
And action.

1465
01:16:51,546 --> 01:16:52,914
There was an incident.

1466
01:16:53,048 --> 01:16:54,716
Lord George
didn't come through it.

1467
01:16:54,849 --> 01:16:56,418
Didn't come through it?

1468
01:16:56,551 --> 01:16:58,920
The last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus.

1469
01:16:59,054 --> 01:17:00,355
Octopus?

1470
01:17:01,623 --> 01:17:04,392
What does that mean?
It's not a very good translation.

1471
01:17:04,526 --> 01:17:06,094
No, there's nothing wrong
with the translation.

1472
01:17:06,228 --> 01:17:07,896
Matthew's not that fluent.
And it's Cantonese.

1473
01:17:08,029 --> 01:17:09,564
Just go with it
and fill in the blanks.

1474
01:17:09,699 --> 01:17:11,032
And action.

1475
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:13,735
[Raymond] <i>It's all on Michael.
He's to blame.</i>

1476
01:17:14,502 --> 01:17:15,904
[Fletcher]
<i>That is not a smart move.</i>

1477
01:17:16,037 --> 01:17:18,006
Don't tell me
what a smart move is.

1478
01:17:18,139 --> 01:17:19,274
[Fletcher]
<i>I beg for your pardon.</i>

1479
01:17:19,407 --> 01:17:21,109
You heard me
perfectly well.

1480
01:17:21,243 --> 01:17:23,778
<i>There will be repercussions
for Michael's actions.</i>

1481
01:17:23,912 --> 01:17:25,547
You think you're
running things, do you?

1482
01:17:26,047 --> 01:17:27,949
<i>Don't stroke my mouse hair.</i>

1483
01:17:29,217 --> 01:17:32,320
- What does "mouse hair" mean?
- Yeah, I think what he means is don't jeopardize my deal,

1484
01:17:32,454 --> 01:17:34,289
but I admit that one's
a bit of a googly.

1485
01:17:34,422 --> 01:17:36,091
Then Matthew loses it a bit

1486
01:17:36,224 --> 01:17:38,560
and his translation goes
completely out of the window.

1487
01:17:38,694 --> 01:17:41,496
Something about springtime
and sweaters.

1488
01:17:41,631 --> 01:17:43,131
I think what he means
is he's upset.

1489
01:17:43,265 --> 01:17:44,634
<i>And then Dry Eye
says something,</i>

1490
01:17:44,766 --> 01:17:46,268
<i>but some cunt
moved in front of me,</i>

1491
01:17:46,401 --> 01:17:47,737
<i>so I didn't get that
either.</i>

1492
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:49,938
Your Cantonese
is dog shit,

1493
01:17:50,071 --> 01:17:51,139
so I'm gonna say this
in English

1494
01:17:51,273 --> 01:17:52,307
and I'm gonna say it once,

1495
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,142
so listen to me,
Rubenstein.

1496
01:17:56,712 --> 01:17:58,446
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1497
01:17:59,814 --> 01:18:01,483
You're gonna
back the fuck off...

1498
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:04,152
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1499
01:18:05,453 --> 01:18:08,189
And you will pay me
my respect.

1500
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:11,526
[Fletcher] And there you have it.
That's all I've got.

1501
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:14,496
Sorry. Show's over.

1502
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:17,299
But I think
it's quite clear

1503
01:18:17,432 --> 01:18:19,868
that they're not just
mah-jongg partners, are they?

1504
01:18:20,435 --> 01:18:21,503
Mm?

1505
01:18:29,077 --> 01:18:31,513
Not all of that
was clear, Fletcher.

1506
01:18:31,647 --> 01:18:33,281
I mean,
according to you,

1507
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:35,751
we already know Matthew
wants to buy Michael out.

1508
01:18:36,786 --> 01:18:40,255
- So why is that news?
- Oh, don't you worry, my darling.

1509
01:18:40,388 --> 01:18:42,190
We are gonna
come to the news.

1510
01:18:42,891 --> 01:18:45,593
<i>I'm approaching my climax.</i>

1511
01:18:46,561 --> 01:18:48,930
[chattering]

1512
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:53,601
Dry Eye.

1513
01:18:54,135 --> 01:18:57,439
I trust you will make
Michael Pearson pay for this.

1514
01:18:58,306 --> 01:19:00,275
You are
the dragon head now.

1515
01:19:00,408 --> 01:19:02,177
Solidify your position.

1516
01:19:03,646 --> 01:19:04,979
It will be done, Uncle.

1517
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:08,950
[Fletcher] <i>So Dry Eye got the upgrade
he was after, didn't he, Raymond?</i>

1518
01:19:09,084 --> 01:19:11,519
<i>The question is,
what was he gonna do with it</i>

1519
01:19:11,654 --> 01:19:13,656
<i>now that he's
Billy Big Bollocks?</i>

1520
01:19:13,789 --> 01:19:15,390
Give me ten minutes,
Ray.

1521
01:19:16,524 --> 01:19:17,559
Boss.

["Cumberland Gap"

1523
01:19:31,473 --> 01:19:32,808
Hello, Ros.

1524
01:19:32,941 --> 01:19:34,943
It's date night tonight,

1525
01:19:35,076 --> 01:19:37,847
9:00 p.m., you and I,
River Cafe.

1526
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:40,248
Nine o'clock? I'll be there.

01:19:40,783 --> 01:19:41,950
[door opens]

1528
01:19:44,052 --> 01:19:45,620
We're closed.

1529
01:19:45,755 --> 01:19:46,888
[man] Hang up.

1530
01:19:48,724 --> 01:19:49,759
No.

1531
01:19:50,325 --> 01:19:51,426
[man]
<i>Hang the fucking phone up.</i>

1532
01:19:51,559 --> 01:19:52,594
Who's there?

1533
01:19:54,562 --> 01:19:56,097
Ros, who's there?

1534
01:19:56,431 --> 01:19:57,599
<i>What you doing here,
Dry Eye?</i>

[chuckles]

1538
01:20:01,603 --> 01:20:03,438
It's warming up now,
isn't it?

1539
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:07,275
At this point, I'm guessing
that you didn't even know

1540
01:20:07,409 --> 01:20:09,444
that Lord George
was dead yet,

1541
01:20:09,577 --> 01:20:11,946
let alone
what Dry Eye was up to.

1542
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,549
Hello, Dry Eye.
What do you want?

1543
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:16,384
[phone beeps]

1544
01:20:17,986 --> 01:20:19,387

1545
01:20:26,961 --> 01:20:28,062
Fancy a boiled sweet?

1546
01:20:28,731 --> 01:20:31,266
- No.
- Suit yourself.

1547
01:20:39,574 --> 01:20:40,910
Who the fuck was he?

[Fletcher] <i>I'm not exactly

to give me the slip.</i>

1550
01:20:45,915 --> 01:20:47,949
They got Rosalind.
Call Roger.

1551
01:20:49,617 --> 01:20:51,821
Oh, goody. Another bottle.
[chuckles]

1552
01:20:51,953 --> 01:20:54,088
Hold on. You were there?

1553
01:20:54,222 --> 01:20:56,324
[camera shutter clicking]

1554
01:20:56,792 --> 01:20:58,828
Yeah.
Of course I was there.

1555
01:20:59,561 --> 01:21:02,932
He's not picking up. Maybe you
should put your seat belt on.

1556
01:21:04,098 --> 01:21:06,100
Yeah, let me call Rosalind.
Let me do it.

1557
01:21:06,401 --> 01:21:07,469
[car horn honks]

1558
01:21:07,602 --> 01:21:09,772
I got it.
Just watch the road.

1559
01:21:10,605 --> 01:21:12,440
- [phone ringing]
- Now, Rosalind, don't be alarmed,

1560
01:21:12,574 --> 01:21:14,275
but you're gonna
come with me

1561
01:21:14,409 --> 01:21:16,645
until I can resolve all these
issues with your husband.

1562
01:21:17,412 --> 01:21:18,814
I'm not going anywhere.

1563
01:21:19,614 --> 01:21:21,483
She's not picking up.
It's just ringing.

1564
01:21:21,616 --> 01:21:24,419
- Fuck.
- We could just slow down a little bit.

1565
01:21:26,254 --> 01:21:27,622
Fuck!

1566
01:21:35,631 --> 01:21:36,665
[gasps]

1567
01:21:42,337 --> 01:21:43,973
[Dry Eye]
<i>You know how it works.</i>

1568
01:21:44,673 --> 01:21:48,176
You either come with me or Tony
here is gonna make you come with me.

1569
01:21:48,309 --> 01:21:51,012
You're in my office
under my roof.

1570
01:21:51,145 --> 01:21:52,915
It's not your position
for Tony to do anything

1571
01:21:53,047 --> 01:21:55,383
other than to fuck off back
from whence he came.

1572
01:21:55,517 --> 01:21:57,151
- [Tony chuckles]
- Tony.

1573
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,724
What's that?
Is that a paperweight?

1574
01:22:01,857 --> 01:22:05,360
Funny you should say that. Turns out
anything with weight can be a paperweight.

1575
01:22:05,493 --> 01:22:07,663
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

1576
01:22:07,796 --> 01:22:10,164
Either you do as I tell
you to and use the door,

1577
01:22:10,298 --> 01:22:12,701
or I'm gonna shoot fat Tony
right between the eyes.

1578
01:22:12,835 --> 01:22:14,837
You see, this gun's
only got two bullets,

1579
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:17,405
so I'm not gonna fuck about
illustrating its significance.

1580
01:22:17,539 --> 01:22:19,274
You're gonna have to
trust me on that.

1581
01:22:19,407 --> 01:22:21,209
The alternative
is a little bit absolute.

1582
01:22:22,477 --> 01:22:24,379
I'm gonna have
to check your grammar on that.

1583
01:22:24,847 --> 01:22:27,016
It can't be
just a little bit absolute.

1584
01:22:27,148 --> 01:22:29,617
It either is or it isn't.

1585
01:22:29,752 --> 01:22:32,855
Whatever it is,
I've lost my patience.

1586
01:22:32,988 --> 01:22:36,859
I'm telling you, I will squeeze this
trigger and Tony will be no more.

1587
01:22:36,992 --> 01:22:38,861
- Tony.
- [Tony exhales]

1588
01:22:40,228 --> 01:22:42,765
Listen to me, cunt.
You take one step forward,

1589
01:22:42,898 --> 01:22:44,733
it'll be the last fucking
step you ever take.

1590
01:22:44,867 --> 01:22:46,234
Tony, get on it.

1591
01:22:47,135 --> 01:22:48,169
[gasps]

1592
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,354

[panting]

1594
01:23:21,569 --> 01:23:22,972
I fucking dare you.

1595
01:23:25,674 --> 01:23:26,775
Just calm down.

1596
01:23:27,876 --> 01:23:28,911
I'm leaving.

1597
01:23:36,584 --> 01:23:38,053
I guess that's
your two bullets, eh?

1598
01:23:39,021 --> 01:23:40,321
Rosalind!

1599
01:23:40,622 --> 01:23:41,623

Rosalind!

[Dry Eye grunts]

1603
01:24:02,143 --> 01:24:03,846
Stay fucking still!

1604
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,054
Hello, babe.

01:24:28,937 --> 01:24:30,005
Hello, love.

1610
01:24:30,673 --> 01:24:32,908
[Raymond] <i>So you're
basing your whole crescendo</i>

1611
01:24:33,441 --> 01:24:35,077
on a figment
of your imagination.

1612
01:24:35,209 --> 01:24:38,981
I'm basing my whole crescendo
on the sum of its parts.

1613
01:24:39,114 --> 01:24:41,349
A few minor details aside,
I wouldn't have any trouble at all

1614
01:24:41,482 --> 01:24:45,453
selling this juicy peach
of a drama to Big Dave.

1615
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:47,488
He'd cream
his fucking panties.

1616
01:24:47,622 --> 01:24:50,291
You're too smart to be
blackmailing us, Fletcher.

1617
01:24:50,425 --> 01:24:53,128
Yes, yes, and obviously I've
taken precautionary measures.

1618
01:24:53,428 --> 01:24:56,832
[chuckles] You can do all kinds of
horrible things to me if you want.

1619
01:24:57,331 --> 01:24:59,134
I might even enjoy them.

1620
01:24:59,267 --> 01:25:01,870
But you'd have to leave the
country and never come back.

1621
01:25:02,004 --> 01:25:03,972
So is that the story over
now, Fletcher?

1622
01:25:04,106 --> 01:25:07,810
All this, this whole buildup,
was leading to this next part.

1623
01:25:07,943 --> 01:25:11,180
This is the news that
you were asking about before.

1624
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:12,748
Ready?

1625
01:25:13,347 --> 01:25:14,382
Matthew.

1626
01:25:15,216 --> 01:25:17,019
<i>He's gonna need some people
to run his business here</i>

1627
01:25:17,152 --> 01:25:19,054
<i>when he buys it
from Michael, right?</i>

1628
01:25:19,188 --> 01:25:21,990
He's gonna need a reliable pair of
hands, someone like you.

1629
01:25:22,124 --> 01:25:24,093
Hmm. So why didn't he
ask you, Raymond?

1630
01:25:24,225 --> 01:25:26,594
I don't know.
It's none of my business.

1631
01:25:26,729 --> 01:25:28,262
Because, I'll tell you,

1632
01:25:28,897 --> 01:25:31,399
he already had someone
earmarked for the role.

1633
01:25:32,201 --> 01:25:35,336
<i>Dry Eye.
He promised Dry Eye the job,</i>

1634
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:39,240
but only if Dry Eye helped drive
down the price of Mickey's business.

1635
01:25:39,373 --> 01:25:43,746
You see, it was Matthew who told Dry
Eye the location of Mickey's farm,

1636
01:25:43,879 --> 01:25:46,247
<i>so he could steal
his white widow super cheese</i>

1637
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:48,650
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value.

1638
01:25:48,784 --> 01:25:51,452
And that is why Phuc,
in turn,

1639
01:25:51,586 --> 01:25:55,824
<i>got those juice-swilling,
acne-backed muscle Marys to do the job.</i>

1640
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:57,826
<i>It was Matthew</i>

1641
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:00,729
who set this whole
train of events off.

1642
01:26:01,529 --> 01:26:03,799
<i>But what he did not
plan on, you see...</i>

1643
01:26:03,932 --> 01:26:05,634
Fuck you,
you old cunt!

1644
01:26:05,768 --> 01:26:07,069
I'll piss on your grave.

1645
01:26:09,738 --> 01:26:11,339
<i>...was Dry Eye...</i>

1646
01:26:13,242 --> 01:26:14,475
killing Lord George.

1647
01:26:15,944 --> 01:26:19,580
<i>Now, Dry Eye does not want to be
subservient to Matthew anymore.</i>

1648
01:26:19,715 --> 01:26:21,116
Doesn't wanna be
subservient to anyone.

1649
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,018
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1650
01:26:23,152 --> 01:26:24,418
[crowd cheering,
applauding]

1651
01:26:24,552 --> 01:26:26,354
You're gonna
back the fuck off

1652
01:26:26,889 --> 01:26:28,857
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1653
01:26:28,991 --> 01:26:32,694
Dry Eye likes the smell of
power and does not like Matthew.

1654
01:26:32,828 --> 01:26:37,199
<i>So, the little dragon needed a gentle
reminder of who was really running things.</i>

1655
01:26:37,331 --> 01:26:39,367
You've been in this paddling
pool for two minutes.

1656
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,336
I've been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years.

1657
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:45,040
I'll tell you
how this plays out.

1658
01:26:45,774 --> 01:26:47,276
You will drown...

1659
01:26:48,409 --> 01:26:51,146
and then my Mossad crabs
will eat you.

1660
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:56,151
And this, my love, is why I want
my hard-earned 20 million pounds.

1661
01:26:56,285 --> 01:27:02,323
Because not only do I know exactly
how Mickey's business operates,

1662
01:27:02,456 --> 01:27:06,762
but I also know that the very
man he's trying to sell it to

1663
01:27:06,895 --> 01:27:09,530
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap

1664
01:27:09,665 --> 01:27:12,600
and has indirectly
started a war.

1665
01:27:13,302 --> 01:27:16,638
So, you see, I think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere,

1666
01:27:17,605 --> 01:27:19,141
or your spy
behind the lines,

1667
01:27:19,274 --> 01:27:23,278
your intellectual
reconnaissance, if you prefer.

1668
01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:26,181
I'm impressed.

1669
01:27:27,415 --> 01:27:29,617
You certainly know
more than I do.

1670
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:32,486
I'm impressed not only
by your information,

1671
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,723
but by your imagination.

1672
01:27:35,489 --> 01:27:36,725
Thank you very much.

1673
01:27:39,328 --> 01:27:41,129
So you've got 72 hours.

1674
01:27:42,164 --> 01:27:45,366
And I would just reiterate
that if anything happens to me,

1675
01:27:45,499 --> 01:27:47,836
I do have my insurance policy
in place.

1676
01:27:48,303 --> 01:27:51,073
Everything will go to Big Dave,
and from him to the public,

1677
01:27:51,206 --> 01:27:53,175
and you, my love,
will go to Mars.

1678
01:27:53,308 --> 01:27:56,377
So, strong recommendation,
just pay up

1679
01:27:56,510 --> 01:28:02,050
and watch me recede into the
sunset blowing kisses, yes?

1680
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:09,258
Well, then, time to use the
door, you black bastard.

1681
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:11,727

it, 'cause I'm not black.

No, but your fucking soul is,
you dark cunt.

Now, out of my house,
'cause I'm going to bed.

1684
01:28:22,536 --> 01:28:24,039
Can I come with you?

1685
01:28:25,406 --> 01:28:29,443
No, but you can go smoke the exhaust
pipe in the back of your hearse.

1686
01:28:31,113 --> 01:28:32,546
I might come anyway.

1687
01:28:34,116 --> 01:28:36,752
You'll just hear me

Now, you keep this
between you and me, Hammy,

1702
01:29:29,438 --> 01:29:32,007
but Fletcher's been in touch.
He says he's got what we need.

1703
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:34,608
Careful, boss. Fletcher's ass
belongs to the highest bidder.

1704
01:29:34,743 --> 01:29:36,610
Yeah.
He says he wants 150 grand.

1705
01:29:36,745 --> 01:29:39,114

a whole week's exclusive.

Well, what does he
have exactly?

tickling me nuts,

he wants to meet Saturday.

this brief moment in time

1749

I've found my way
into the film business,

1750
01:31:49,244 --> 01:31:53,949
and last night I made a film with
an impressively sized farmyard pig.

01:31:57,953 --> 01:32:00,422
Morning, sir.
Two cups of tea.

One with sugar, one without.

1753
01:32:03,225 --> 01:32:05,193

Your clothes are neatly folded
there on the bench.

press the space bar on this computer

and you're gonna witness your
participation in said film.

Now, that little drug we
gave you last night really...

1760

your inhibitions, man.

from becoming

1763

in the future of Mickey Pearson.

- The market's changed.
- How so?

1810
01:34:54,996 --> 01:34:58,600
The exit value of your business
needs to be recalculated.

1811
01:34:59,334 --> 01:35:01,269
Please, be specific.

1812
01:35:01,403 --> 01:35:03,305
Oh, I will be.

1813
01:35:03,438 --> 01:35:06,776
You're asking 400 for 12 locations
and a distribution network,

1814
01:35:06,908 --> 01:35:09,377
which was a fair valuation
at the time.

1815
01:35:09,511 --> 01:35:12,314
But when one of those
locations was compromised,

1816
01:35:12,447 --> 01:35:14,784
the value of all those
locations were compromised

1817
01:35:14,916 --> 01:35:16,618
and this obviously
affects the price.

1818
01:35:17,452 --> 01:35:21,089
Your skunk farm was a fucking viral
sensation on YouTube, Michael.

1819

And when Johnny Law starts
sniffing, which he will,

1820
01:35:23,825 --> 01:35:25,927
all of those locations
will have to cease production

1821
01:35:26,061 --> 01:35:29,831

at a cost of 100 million net p.a.,

at least three years

1825
01:35:37,005 --> 01:35:40,475
to get your supply, distribution
and demand back to full capacity.

1826
01:35:40,608 --> 01:35:44,346
Your staffing costs are 25% of
your 100 million operational cost,

1827
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:48,049
so that's 25 million per annum
for three annums.

1828
01:35:48,183 --> 01:35:50,518
And location rental
at 15 million a year,

1829
01:35:50,653 --> 01:35:54,690
that's a 120 GBP bite
right there.

1830
01:35:54,824 --> 01:35:57,392
Your unit economics
have taken a hit,

1831
01:35:57,525 --> 01:36:02,063
and forecasting out your top-line growth
margin in the current inimical climate,

1832
01:36:02,197 --> 01:36:05,467
I calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago

1833
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:10,071
must now be valued
at an anemic, mm... 130.

1834
01:36:11,306 --> 01:36:15,043
You see, it's not about the
first domino that fell, Michael.

1835
01:36:15,877 --> 01:36:17,045
It's about the last.

1836
01:36:19,381 --> 01:36:20,448
Please.

1837
01:36:23,985 --> 01:36:26,722
I like you, Michael.
You're a good chap.

1838
01:36:27,522 --> 01:36:31,226
And if you want me to help you out of
this hole you've found yourself in,

1839
01:36:31,861 --> 01:36:34,896
I can pay you
100 million dollars today.

1840
01:36:35,897 --> 01:36:38,366
It's a good offer
and it's real,

1841
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,636
and I'll do this
because I'm your friend.

1842
01:36:40,770 --> 01:36:43,873
My accountant can transfer
the fee within the hour.

1843
01:36:44,774 --> 01:36:46,809
I like your domino analogy.

1844
01:36:48,543 --> 01:36:52,580
The question I ask is,
who tumbled the first domino?

1845
01:36:53,214 --> 01:36:56,317
I'm afraid that's not my
concern or my business, Michael.

1846
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:58,286
At the risk
of contradicting you,

1847
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:02,390
it is very much your business,
and certainly your concern.

1848
01:37:03,859 --> 01:37:05,326
Only you made one mistake.

1849
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:07,830
That being?

1850
01:37:08,430 --> 01:37:11,399
You seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt.

1851
01:37:13,234 --> 01:37:15,638
Let me introduce you
to the first domino.

1852
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:24,379
It's a tad dramatic, isn't it,
corpses in freezers? Who is this man?

1853
01:37:24,512 --> 01:37:26,548
What's he got to do with
anything that I'm talking about?

1854
01:37:26,682 --> 01:37:29,284
I take it with that statement
you are in denial

1855
01:37:29,417 --> 01:37:31,986
of so-said relationship
with this frozen Chinaman?

1856
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:34,289
Well, of course
I'm in denial of it.

1857
01:37:34,422 --> 01:37:38,092
I don't have relationships
with dead, frozen Chinamen.

1858
01:37:38,226 --> 01:37:41,797
Best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings, Matthew.

1859
01:37:45,533 --> 01:37:47,770
Don't bother looking
for your Mossad crabs.

1860
01:37:47,903 --> 01:37:50,338
This is a fish market.
They have found a home.

1861
01:37:50,873 --> 01:37:53,408
To be clear,
I do not know that man.

1862
01:37:55,711 --> 01:37:57,512
<i>I'll tell you
how this plays out.</i>

1863
01:37:58,112 --> 01:38:02,685
<i>You will drown and then
my Mossad crabs will eat you.</i>

1864
01:38:02,818 --> 01:38:06,120
So while you were discussing
who would take over my business

1865
01:38:06,254 --> 01:38:07,756
after you fucked it,

1866
01:38:08,724 --> 01:38:11,794
you somehow mistook so-said
Chinaman for someone else?

1867
01:38:13,461 --> 01:38:17,499
Business is business, Michael.
It's nothing personal.

1868
01:38:17,633 --> 01:38:19,969
While I am not emotional
about the money,

1869
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:23,873
there is a price indebted to me for
the blood I've gotten on my hands

1870
01:38:24,005 --> 01:38:27,408
restoring order to the
untidiness that you created,

1871
01:38:27,542 --> 01:38:29,177
and that price,
according to you...

1872
01:38:29,310 --> 01:38:33,348
400 minus 130...
is 270 million dollars.

1873
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:36,551
And I'm keeping
the business,

1874
01:38:37,853 --> 01:38:40,990
while you are
getting in the freezer.

1875
01:38:41,657 --> 01:38:44,760
And you will make that transaction if
you want to get out of the freezer.

1876
01:38:44,894 --> 01:38:49,364
It is 25 below zero in there,
so I assume you'll last about an hour.

1877
01:38:49,497 --> 01:38:51,266
That said,
I wouldn't fuck about,

1878
01:38:51,399 --> 01:38:53,568
because frostbite is very
expensive on the fingers and toes,

1879
01:38:53,702 --> 01:38:57,539
so I would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them.

1880
01:38:58,239 --> 01:39:00,341
- Uh...
- After you've attended to that indiscretion,

1881
01:39:00,475 --> 01:39:04,345
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness.

1882
01:39:04,914 --> 01:39:08,884
As stated,
I am not emotional about the money.

1883
01:39:11,586 --> 01:39:15,256
But I am emotional about the fact that
someone laid their hands on my wife.

1884
01:39:16,157 --> 01:39:18,459
[panting]

1885
01:39:18,593 --> 01:39:19,862
My wife!

1886
01:39:22,463 --> 01:39:25,901
No amount of money on God's green earth
can pay for that transgression, Matthew.

1887
01:39:26,035 --> 01:39:27,602
No, for that...

1888
01:39:31,472 --> 01:39:32,708
I want a pound of flesh.

1889
01:39:33,876 --> 01:39:34,944
A pound of flesh?

1890
01:39:35,076 --> 01:39:36,611
It matters not to me

1891
01:39:36,745 --> 01:39:38,747
where on your anatomy
it is withdrawn from.

1892
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:42,885
If you don't have the stomach
to take it for yourself,

1893
01:39:43,018 --> 01:39:45,119
big Bunny here
is very adept with a knife,

1894
01:39:45,253 --> 01:39:47,088
and, as you can see,
he's dressed for the weather.

1895
01:39:47,221 --> 01:39:51,526
But a penny short
or a gram shy...

1896
01:39:52,928 --> 01:39:55,363
and that freezer door
does not open.

1897
01:39:55,496 --> 01:39:56,531
Am I clear?

1898
01:39:57,666 --> 01:39:58,701
Good.

1899
01:39:59,768 --> 01:40:01,436
- Bunny.
- [Bunny] Incoming.

1900
01:40:11,714 --> 01:40:14,083
- [sizzles]
- [Fletcher chuckles]

1901
01:40:14,215 --> 01:40:16,618
What, is it Wagyu again
for breakfast, Raymond?

1902
01:40:18,954 --> 01:40:22,624
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend?

1903
01:40:27,997 --> 01:40:30,099
What's that for?
Is that for my money?

1904
01:40:30,598 --> 01:40:32,101
[chuckles]

1905
01:40:32,567 --> 01:40:33,702
Where's my money, Raymond?

1906
01:40:33,836 --> 01:40:35,303
There's your payment.

1907
01:40:39,108 --> 01:40:40,608
Go on, take a look.

1908
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:42,610
Thank you,
mysterious stranger.

1909
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:55,289
Well, that's disappointing, 'cause that
doesn't look like 20 million pounds.

1910
01:40:55,423 --> 01:40:58,459
It's more interesting than that,
your insurance policy,

1911
01:40:58,593 --> 01:41:01,997
all the photos, all the bodies,
all the skeletons, all the filth.

1912
01:41:02,131 --> 01:41:06,367
It's not the only one,
darling. I'm not a mong.

1913
01:41:06,501 --> 01:41:08,804
What do you think's in that,
you fucking eejit?

1914
01:41:09,672 --> 01:41:11,807
[Raymond] Of course we were
aware of what Matthew was up to.

1915
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,676
We're not complete
fucking idiots.

1916
01:41:13,809 --> 01:41:15,744
[sizzles]

1917
01:41:15,878 --> 01:41:18,647
I've been onto you
for a long time, Fletcher.

1918
01:41:19,614 --> 01:41:21,684
- I knew you'd been following Michael.
- [camera shutter clicks]

1919
01:41:21,817 --> 01:41:23,451
<i>They're very similar,
our jobs.</i>

1920
01:41:24,019 --> 01:41:26,254
<i>Only I'm better at it
than you are.</i>

1921
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:31,526
I knew when you came over that night that
you'd only be there for half an hour...

1922
01:41:32,393 --> 01:41:34,328
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

1923
01:41:34,462 --> 01:41:37,532
...to tell me how clever you
are and try to blackmail us.

1924
01:41:38,266 --> 01:41:40,535
I've got some very important
information to impart to you, Raymond.

1925
01:41:40,669 --> 01:41:44,173
I also knew you couldn't
resist a £1500 single malt,

1926
01:41:44,305 --> 01:41:47,710
an £80 Wagyu steak and a
state-of-the-art smokeless barbie

1927
01:41:48,276 --> 01:41:50,913
- that even keeps your feet warm.
- I love a barbie.

1928
01:41:51,046 --> 01:41:53,916
I promise you, you will regret
this if you don't hear it.

1929
01:41:54,049 --> 01:41:56,685
And when the Scotch
got into your cold veins,

1930
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:59,520
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts.

1931
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:02,223
Oh, goody. Another bottle.
[chuckles]

1932
01:42:02,356 --> 01:42:04,893
Can you tell the mysterious
gentleman to relax?

1933
01:42:05,027 --> 01:42:08,063
Because I promise you, you will regret it
if you don't hear this. Sit down, my love.

1934
01:42:08,197 --> 01:42:11,599
See, I kept you there 'cause I needed
to know about Matthew and Dry Eye.

1935
01:42:12,801 --> 01:42:15,838
<i>Took us a while to find
your insurance policies.</i>

1936
01:42:17,505 --> 01:42:19,540
<i>'Cause you're
a naughty squirrel, Fletcher.</i>

1937
01:42:20,475 --> 01:42:22,610
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1938
01:42:22,745 --> 01:42:24,046
Yes, Mommy.

1939
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:28,416
<i>But it was made a lot easier after
I planted a tracker in your shoe.</i>

1940
01:42:32,888 --> 01:42:35,090
<i>You're never gonna be
a predator with us, Fletcher.</i>

1941
01:42:36,959 --> 01:42:38,794
You're always
gonna be prey.

1942
01:42:40,028 --> 01:42:43,397
So that's it. Three strikes.
We're good, right?

1943
01:42:46,101 --> 01:42:49,238
- I'll see you around.
- With the greatest respect, I hope not.

1944
01:42:55,576 --> 01:42:59,982
[sighs] Now, Fletcher,
what were you saying?

1945
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:03,284
[Fletcher, muffled] It wasn't
Lord George that was after Mickey,

1946
01:43:03,417 --> 01:43:05,854
or Dry Eye, or Matthew.

1947
01:43:06,989 --> 01:43:08,322
Do you wanna know who it was?

1948
01:43:12,961 --> 01:43:14,163
I've got photos.

1949
01:43:16,899 --> 01:43:18,767
Right.
You've got 30 seconds.

1950
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:19,935
Thank you, darling.

1951
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:23,806
- [phone vibrating]
- Fuck.

1952
01:43:25,573 --> 01:43:27,009
Primetime,
what is it, son?

1953
01:43:27,142 --> 01:43:29,945
Coach, we're gonna take
care of this for you.

1954
01:43:30,078 --> 01:43:31,445
Ernie's got a plan.

1955
01:43:31,713 --> 01:43:33,414
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1956
01:43:33,548 --> 01:43:36,785
The Michael situation.
We're gonna sort it.

1957
01:43:36,919 --> 01:43:38,287
[cocks gun]

1958
01:43:38,553 --> 01:43:40,155
- Primetime, listen... Prime...
- [phone beeps]

1959
01:43:41,622 --> 01:43:42,590
Jesus.

1960
01:43:42,724 --> 01:43:44,325
[gate clinks]

1961
01:43:53,735 --> 01:43:55,503
[Fletcher] <i>Now, you
remember Aslan, don't you?</i>

1962
01:43:56,138 --> 01:43:58,640
The young gentleman
you kept in the freezer?

1963
01:44:01,109 --> 01:44:05,647
Well, this is Aslan Senior,
Russian oligarch.

1964
01:44:07,149 --> 01:44:09,350
<i>Ex-KGB. Made all
his money in gas pipes.</i>

1965
01:44:09,483 --> 01:44:12,688
And he's extremely sad that his
one-and-only son fell out of a window.

1966
01:44:13,155 --> 01:44:14,656
[boy] Oh, shit.

1967
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:16,859
And I fear that where
they failed before, Raymond,

1968
01:44:16,992 --> 01:44:19,194
they're not gonna fail again.

1969
01:44:19,328 --> 01:44:21,330
And how do you know
all this?

1970
01:44:21,462 --> 01:44:24,666
Because someone told them everything
they want to know about Michael,

1971
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,468
and that someone is me.

1972
01:44:28,670 --> 01:44:29,872
Go on.

1973
01:44:30,839 --> 01:44:33,574
[Fletcher] <i>So I said I'd tell them
where Michael was for a price.</i>

1974
01:44:34,475 --> 01:44:38,280
But that money was pending till
after, you know, the deed was done.

1975
01:44:38,412 --> 01:44:39,447
[gunshot]

1976
01:44:40,249 --> 01:44:42,050
<i>And then when they
messed up the first time,</i>

1977
01:44:42,184 --> 01:44:45,519
I had a little rethink and came
up with my version 2.0 plan,

1978
01:44:45,654 --> 01:44:47,555
which is
when I came to see you.

1979
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:50,391
You see, get my 20 mils
off Michael first

1980
01:44:50,524 --> 01:44:54,930
and then, after the event,
get paid again, double bubble.

1981
01:44:55,063 --> 01:44:58,466
But you and your mysterious friend
put paid to that, so well done, you.

1982
01:44:59,268 --> 01:45:00,769
Why did you just
look at your watch?

1983
01:45:02,237 --> 01:45:05,774
Well, it's like I say.
The Russians are gonna clean house.

1984
01:45:05,908 --> 01:45:08,977
And you are part of
that house, Raymond.

1985
01:45:09,111 --> 01:45:12,080
They're gonna get Michael when he comes
out of his meeting at the fish market.

1986
