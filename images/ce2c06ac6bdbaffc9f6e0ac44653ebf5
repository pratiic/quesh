1
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,144
<i>Good morning, Mr. Bryce.</i>

2
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,146
<i>I trust the pickup ran smoothly.</i>

3
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,065
Hand-off was clean.
No stops till the exit point.

4
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,446
<i>Clear roads all the way, chief,</i>

5
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,240
<i>just as you predicted.</i>

6
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,158
Thank you for agreeing

7
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,118
to an earlier departure time,
Mr. kurosawa.

8
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,620
I'm honored that you and your wives

9
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,747
have entrusted
a triple-a protection service today.

10
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,463
<i>Moving red to green option,
coming in on your vector.</i>

11
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,341
<i>Get the engine started,
i want an immediate takeoff.</i>

12
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,051
<i>Air space has already been cleared.</i>

13
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,510
<i>Roger that.</i>

14
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>All channels moving
to restricted air space.</i>

15
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,227
Shall we?

16
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:38,909
Mr. kurosawa...

17
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,587
<i>Another
triple-a delivery, sir.</i>

18
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,922
Stay with him
till he's airborne.

19
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,715
- Yes, sir.
- Canvas is clear?

20
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,593
<i>Nothing for miles, chief. Almost boring.</i>

21
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:57,803
And what's our motto?

22
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,138
Boring is always best.

23
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,733
Move! Move!

24
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,944
Client down! Client down!

25
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,070
<i>Code seven! Code seven!</i>

26
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,238
Jesus!

27
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,365
<i>It's like a goddamn milkshake in here!</i>

28
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,783
<i>Bravo one down.</i>

29
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,743
<i><i>We need</i>
a <i>clean-up team in here now!</i>

30
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,745
<i>Repeat, bravo one down.</i>

31
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,925
Fucking piece of paper I've got here.

32
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,471
...l'm gonna beat this motherfucker's...

33
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:26,975
Holy shit.

34
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,482
Mr. seifert.

35
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,403
- Are we ready to go?
-"Are we ready?"

36
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,529
I've been waiting!

37
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,240
What the hell took you so long?
It's half past 9:00!

38
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,659
Apologies. I had to make some
preparations-- Mr. seifert.

39
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:45,660
Mr. seifert!

40
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,538
It's best if I go through doors first.

41
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:49,956
- Okay?
- Okay.

42
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,542
You don't know what I'm dealing with here.

43
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:53,835
Come on, let's go, let's go.

44
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,836
- Double time.
- You don't understand.

45
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,588
These people are animals!

46
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,465
They're probably here already,

47
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,468
-just waiting for me to leave.
- I can appreciate your concern,

48
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,345
but I assure you, you are perfectly safe.

49
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,555
All you need to do
is exactly what I tell you.

50
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,683
Mr. seifert? Mr. seifert?
This way, please.

51
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,144
All right. Ls it not enough cocaine,
or too much?

52
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,733
They say you're triple-a rated.

53
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,151
Is that a real thing?

54
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:22,072
Let's just focus on you dying
of natural causes, shall we?

55
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,241
Soon.

56
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,408
That's my car.

57
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,868
Take a mental picture of it.

58
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,954
I find it safer if we're using a car

59
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,789
that blends in
with the surrounding traffic.

60
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,252
Well, that was easy.
In fact, practically nothing at all.

61
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,962
Boring is always best.

62
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,129
I trust you'll reduce your--

63
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:41,716
- what?
- This is Michael Bryce.

64
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,051
I'm an executive protection agent,

65
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,636
fully licensed and bonded within the eu.

66
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,514
<i>Fuckin' hell. I know it's you.
I've got caller ID!</i>

67
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,600
<i>Such a fucking dick.
You got a pickup for me or what?</i>

68
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,521
Yes. I've extracted my client
from 27 Saint George street.

69
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,689
Clean-up is required.

70
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,485
<i>On the seventh floor, north stairwell,
I've left a French national</i>

71
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,112
employed by the taray crime syndicate.

72
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,990
<i>You'll find two more
in the south stairwell.</i>

73
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,784
<i>On the roof, you're gonna find another
who's gonna need some dental work.</i>

74
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,789
<i>Ln the alley, there's two gentlemen
who may require some counseling.</i>

75
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,503
<i>One more in the east office
on the sixth floor under construction</i>

76
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,548
<i>and one on the number three elevator.</i>

77
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,802
Oh, oh, oh!

78
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,221
<i>Parking garage,
under the Rolls-Royce in space five,</i>

79
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,931
<i>there's a pound of plastic explosives,</i>

80
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,433
you might want to call the bomb squad.

81
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,687
Check that. Make it the fire department.

82
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,605
Is that my car?

83
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,149
I'm afraid so. Have a seat,
it's been a long day.

84
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,032
That was a custom Rolls-Royce,
one of a kind.

85
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,742
I thought that was an unusual color.

86
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:49,910
Was that periwinkle?

87
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,287
I did find this in the backseat.

88
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,496
Scraps!

89
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,497
Precious, aren't they?

90
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,418
It smells like ass in here.

91
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,753
Buckle up.

92
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,255
This car certainly
isn't triple-a rated.

93
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,507
It's not even fit for animals.

94
00:07:35,672 --> 00:07:37,674
Keep moving!

95
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,385
Everybody go home!

96
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:42,679
Get out of the way!

97
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:51,605
Have a look there.

98
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:14,406
Knock on the doors.

99
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:23,207
How's your English?

100
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:29,516
I don't know much English, Mr. president.

101
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,105
"The only way for the country to progress

102
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:40,319
is by eradicating the scourge of genocide

103
00:08:40,402 --> 00:08:44,281
blackening our country
and our livelihood."

104
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,203
.L appreciate your modesty.

105
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,042
I hope we're not...
Disturbing your family.

106
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,380
They are on holiday.

107
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:01,840
Good for them.

108
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,136
Family makes a man whole.

109
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,521
I could have
you executed for treason,

110
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:20,150
but another would simply stand
a little bit higher on your corpse.

111
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:25,113
There must be some other lesson
i could teach you.

112
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:34,832
As I said,

113
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,252
there is nothing more important...

114
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,337
Than a good education.

115
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:47,594
<i>Professor Asimov,</i>

116
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,722
can you please tell the court
what happened next?

117
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,309
Then... I was taken

118
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,812
to one of dukhovich's internment camps.

119
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:01,316
I was there for three years

120
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,737
until he was finally overthrown.

121
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:10,325
Arrested like the monster he is.

122
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:14,204
Thank you, professor Asimov.

123
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:18,917
Your honor, I request
that this entire testimony be disregarded.

124
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:22,421
Without any evidence,
this is merely hearsay.

125
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:24,840
Sustained.

126
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:26,675
<i>The trial
of former Belarusian president</i>

127
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:28,594
<i>Vladislav dukhovich continued today</i>

128
00:10:28,677 --> 00:10:31,471
<i>with emotional testimony
from many of his country's victims.</i>

129
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:34,683
But while powerful to hear,
dukhovich's attorneys say

130
00:10:34,766 --> 00:10:37,269
they are nothing more
than the lies of his enemies.

131
00:10:37,352 --> 00:10:39,855
Long one of the world's
most brutal dictators...

132
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:42,524
Who stands accused
of ethnic cleansing on a massive scale.

133
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:45,861
An unprecedented level of security
is in place around the courthouse.

134
00:10:45,944 --> 00:10:48,405
Even the airspace
above this city is closed.

135
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:50,949
So far, the prosecution
has been crippled by the lack

136
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,951
of any hard evidence
against dukhovich himself.

137
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,536
'Numerous witnesses

138
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,663
who were expected
to testify have disappeared.

139
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:59,791
Ls there anyone brave enough
to come forward with evidence

140
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:02,294
and finally put an end
to his brutal reign?

141
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,855
Mr. Kincaid,
this is lnterpol's offer.

142
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:25,150
In return for your testimony
against former president dukhovich,

143
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:28,695
your wife will receive a full
pardon from all jurisdictions.

144
00:11:30,739 --> 00:11:33,700
You're going to pardon an innocent woman?

145
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,828
That's mighty fucking white of you.

146
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:39,790
Assuming we accept this arrangement

147
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,166
for Sonia Kincaid,

148
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,461
there's still the matter
of an agreement regarding my client.

149
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,467
He will receive

150
00:11:51,718 --> 00:11:55,263
this letter recommending leniency.

151
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:57,432
Mr. Kincaid is a contract killer

152
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,935
facing two dozen counts
of murder in ten countries.

153
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:01,728
Absent a legitimate deal,

154
00:12:01,979 --> 00:12:04,314
he will never breathe free air again.
Under no--

155
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:13,907
Sonia goes free.

156
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:17,869
We're all set, director casoria.

157
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,539
Let's get this gentleman to the hague.

158
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:32,092
Mr. Kincaid,
this is agent roussel.

159
00:12:33,176 --> 00:12:34,261
She'll be leading a security detail,

160
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:37,472
which will escort you
to the international criminal court.

161
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:42,436
You know, dukhovich's men have killed
every single witness brought against them,

162
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:45,439
and my security detail
is a dozen off-duty cops?

163
00:12:46,273 --> 00:12:49,234
These are the most highly-trained officers
in Europe, Mr. Kincaid.

164
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,986
We have taken every precaution

165
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:53,780
to make sure that your involvement
is completely classified.

166
00:12:54,448 --> 00:12:55,490
It's a secret?

167
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,160
That makes me feel so much better.

168
00:12:58,452 --> 00:12:59,536
Well, I can assure you,

169
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:01,413
even if there was an attempt,

170
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:03,373
we're more than prepared for any assault.

171
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,003
You prepared for that assault,
motherfucker?

172
00:13:08,628 --> 00:13:10,172
Uncuff me, give me some car keys,
a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there.

173
00:13:10,172 --> 00:13:10,255
Uncuff me, give me some car keys,
a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there.

174
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:12,507
Uncuff me, give me some car keys,
a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there.

175
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:15,469
The court's deadline
is at 5:00 P.M. tomorrow, Mr. Kincaid.

176
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:20,348
That gives us <i>27</i> hours to transport
you from Manchester to the Netherlands.

177
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,936
If you want to help your wife,
you should get moving.

178
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:29,399
Okay, inspector clouseau,

179
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:31,735
let's see what these elite troops
of yours can do.

180
00:13:32,402 --> 00:13:33,361
Come on, guys, let's go.

181
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:37,365
Agent roussel,

182
00:13:38,408 --> 00:13:40,535
I don't have to remind
you of the importance of this.

183
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:43,789
- No, ma'am.
- And don't doubt what he's capable of.

184
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:45,457
I won't, sir.

185
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,777
<i>- Take</i> a <i>left on kirkland Avenue.
- Yes.</i>

186
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:20,742
What a pretty little town.
Old, narrow streets,

187
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:22,828
buildings nice and close,

188
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:25,747
lots of great views
from all those windows.

189
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,374
This route's been wiped clean for us.

190
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:28,458
Nothing to worry about.

191
00:14:28,542 --> 00:14:29,918
Ls that right?

192
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,753
How's that nose of yours doing?

193
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,557
Take a diversion route.

194
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,559
Got a boyfriend, roussie?
Significant other?

195
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:47,894
I need you to be quiet, Mr. Kincaid.

196
00:14:47,978 --> 00:14:50,063
I'm just saying,
now might be the perfect time

197
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:52,274
to write one of those
"I'll always love you" texts.

198
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:58,321
Relax, motherfucker.

199
00:14:58,405 --> 00:15:00,866
If you hear the shot,
it wasn't meant for you.

200
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:05,620
<i>Two-two-one,
ten-four en route.</i>

201
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,729
Fuck!

202
00:15:30,812 --> 00:15:32,189
Cover me!

203
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:33,398
Move! Move!

204
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,782
Cover me!

205
00:16:01,009 --> 00:16:03,803
Move! Move!
Go! Get that door open!

206
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:07,015
Go! Go! Alpha squad, with me!

207
00:16:07,432 --> 00:16:09,392
Agent Roberts, protect the witness!

208
00:16:15,232 --> 00:16:16,566
Parker, take the left flank!

209
00:16:28,995 --> 00:16:30,830
Shit! We need more backup!

210
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,585
Follow me!

211
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:37,087
Fuck!

212
00:16:58,316 --> 00:17:01,236
Agent roussel!
God damn it, somebody!

213
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,612
We need backup n--

214
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,036
turn around!

215
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:11,329
It's ready!

216
00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:12,539
Come on!

217
00:17:23,466 --> 00:17:24,467
Lay down some cover fire.

218
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,333
Fuck!

219
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,188
- Show me your hands!
- Bitch, please!

220
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:21,483
- Put these on.
- Fuck that.

221
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,318
Interpol's compromised. You know that.

222
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,821
Either you shoot me or watch me bleed out.

223
00:18:34,204 --> 00:18:35,455
We gotta get off the street.

224
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:36,998
There's a safe house
not far from here.

225
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,798
<i>As</i> a <i>car bomb has
exploded in bishopgate green,</i>

226
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:46,800
near <i>coventry city center...</i>

227
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,723
Don't even think
about answering that fucking phone!

228
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,434
The only way dukhovich
could've known our route

229
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,478
was if he had somebody on the inside.

230
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:01,689
Now, I need medical supplies,
and you need help.

231
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:03,650
So, if you're gonna call somebody,

232
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:05,944
they have to be totally out of the loop.

233
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:11,199
I've had
the black diamond service

234
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:12,742
four times now, you understand?

235
00:19:13,243 --> 00:19:15,412
Four times. The car still
smells like a cemetery.

236
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,581
Are you washing the car with old assholes?

237
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,667
Or...

238
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,127
Just help me to understand.

239
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:25,797
Just a second here.

240
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:28,716
Hello, Amelia.

241
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:30,677
I'm texting you an address in coventry.

242
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,429
You need to get there immediately.

243
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:34,431
Bring three units of o-negative blood.

244
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:37,434
I'm doing very well, thank you.
How are you?

245
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,769
I don't have
the time for this, Michael.

246
00:19:39,853 --> 00:19:41,479
I have a job I need you to do.

247
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:44,858
- Pass.
- I wasn't offering. I'm telling you.

248
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,401
I have a job you're going to do.

249
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:48,778
<i>I'm not gonna let you charm me
into this one, Amelia.</i>

250
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:50,280
Okay, let's be clear.

251
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:52,323
I'm not any happier about this
than you are,

252
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:53,658
but I don't have a choice.

253
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,618
Well, thank god I do.

254
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,036
<i>No, Michael, you don't.</i>

255
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:59,372
<i>Because if you're not
where I need you to be,</i>

256
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:01,458
<i>I'm going to expose
you and your work to interpol.</i>

257
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,544
That elite triple-a status
you want back so badly,

258
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:07,505
-I'll make sure you never get near it.
- You're threatening me now?

259
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,883
Not you, her. Are you threatening--

260
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:12,093
you can't just threaten me
into taking orders from you.

261
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,054
I guess we'll see. You're three hours
away. I'll see you in two and a half.

262
00:20:15,138 --> 00:20:17,765
Three-- okay, okay.
I guess we will. Jesus Christ.

263
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:20,643
Here, we're gonna load
all these into the car, okay?

264
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:23,271
We're gonna take the car out in the front,
and then burn it.

265
00:20:24,814 --> 00:20:26,566
This place is like a war zone.

266
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:28,109
We got bodies everywhere.

267
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,028
Our unit's compromised. Everyone's down.

268
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:31,571
Get those guys lded.

269
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,531
And I've got no sign of agent roussel.

270
00:20:33,823 --> 00:20:36,618
Maybe 15 to 20
dead mercenaries, heavily armed.

271
00:20:37,118 --> 00:20:38,620
Media circus is in town.

272
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,246
That's not the worst of it.

273
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,250
Kincaid is gone.

274
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:47,795
Coventry, every available agent.

275
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:49,923
Report back to me with any updates.

276
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:51,174
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:54,802
There must've been a leak.

278
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,389
I told you, there are too many
agencies involved.

279
00:20:58,598 --> 00:20:59,516
Get to the hague.

280
00:20:59,933 --> 00:21:01,434
See what you can get out of dukhovich.

281
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:02,810
<i>L'll try.</i>

282
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:05,396
And alert the penitentiary in Amsterdam.

283
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:07,649
Have them triple the guard
around Kincaid's wife.

284
00:21:08,274 --> 00:21:09,192
Got it.

285
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,842
Mrs. Kincaid, your attorney.

286
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,320
Did I tell you you could turn around?

287
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:01,494
What do you want,
you useless piece of shit?

288
00:22:01,995 --> 00:22:03,705
Baby, baby, it's me.

289
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,999
My baql

290
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:07,792
what do you want,

291
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,628
you fucking hijo de puta motherfucker!

292
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:12,547
I just wanted to hear your voice.

293
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,590
Fuck you!

294
00:22:14,215 --> 00:22:16,301
There, you heard my voice.

295
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:20,221
<i>The only reason I'm in this shit hole
is so that they can get to your sorry ass!</i>

296
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:23,891
How you doing? Made a shank yet?

297
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:24,892
<i>What for?</i>

298
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,436
It's prison, baby.
You got to protect yourself.

299
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,022
It's a Dutch prison, Darius!

300
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:30,898
What are they gonna do,
beat me with a clog?

301
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,609
You got a view at least?

302
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:35,695
<i>Just a whole lot of corny Dutch buildings.</i>

303
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:40,116
There's one
with a huge fucking clock on it.

304
00:22:40,783 --> 00:22:42,452
Like that's what I need right now.

305
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:44,329
Do they have those flowers you love?

306
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:47,624
Lrises?
They come from there, right?

307
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:49,792
Fucking tulips, Darius.

308
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:52,962
<i>What kind of a piece-of-shit husband</i>

309
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:55,298
<i>doesn't remember
his wife's favorite flowers?</i>

310
00:22:55,965 --> 00:22:57,383
<i>You never remember anything.</i>

311
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:59,093
What's our anniversary?

312
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,678
I'm gonna make this up to you, baby.

313
00:23:00,762 --> 00:23:03,097
<i>You see, that's what
I'm talking about, cabrén.</i>

314
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:06,392
Darius, is something wrong?

315
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:12,649
Not a thing, baby. Not a fucking thing.

316
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,944
Then I want to hear it.

317
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,844
- Hello? Sonia?
- Hello? Darius!

318
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:46,557
You fucking piece of shit!

319
00:23:49,727 --> 00:23:51,187
You fucking shit!

320
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:21,865
Go ahead,
you might as well finish the job.

321
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,336
Why am I here, Amelia?

322
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:37,255
A high-value transport.

323
00:24:38,882 --> 00:24:42,010
Oh, high value? Oh, I don't...

324
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:45,597
I don't really do high value anymore.
These days I'm more in the...

325
00:24:46,556 --> 00:24:48,141
Mid-level coked-out attorney market.

326
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:50,101
Why do you think that is?

327
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:51,644
Seriously, Michael?

328
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:52,645
Because of you.

329
00:24:52,771 --> 00:24:55,690
You used me to climb the interpol ladder,
and here we are again.

330
00:24:58,924 --> 00:24:59,925
You up for a promotion?

331
00:25:00,468 --> 00:25:02,970
You have to blame me for every little bump
in your road, don't you.

332
00:25:03,053 --> 00:25:05,306
No, these aren't bumps. No, no, no bumps.

333
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:07,600
Just one dead Japanese arms dealer.

334
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:09,852
- I had nothing to do--
-"...To do with."

335
00:25:09,935 --> 00:25:11,103
Do you know what happens

336
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:14,064
when a triple-a rated
executive protection agent

337
00:25:14,148 --> 00:25:15,065
loses a client?

338
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:17,777
Triple-a. I was up here, yeah?

339
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,612
Then I opened up to you. Why wouldn't I?

340
00:25:19,695 --> 00:25:20,780
I was in love with you.

341
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:22,740
And I fucking told you his name.

342
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:26,535
It was the first time in my entire career
i revealed a client's name.

343
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:27,745
I trusted you.

344
00:25:30,498 --> 00:25:33,417
Now I'm down here. The dead guy's up here.

345
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:37,880
I'm sorry, Michael,
you hit a rough patch.

346
00:25:37,963 --> 00:25:39,131
"A rough..."

347
00:25:39,215 --> 00:25:43,219
A 300-pound investment banker's ass
exploded four bags of heroin

348
00:25:43,302 --> 00:25:44,804
in the backseat of my car last week.

349
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:46,722
Those aren't leather seats,
those are cloth.

350
00:25:46,972 --> 00:25:48,599
- Okay, Michael...
- Want you to take a minute

351
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:50,142
to think of what that clean-up might be.

352
00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:52,019
I don't have the time
for your insane shit, okay?

353
00:25:52,102 --> 00:25:53,437
At that point, you sell the car.

354
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:54,855
- I never used you!
- The depreciation--

355
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:56,148
I just left you!

356
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:03,280
Because you couldn't forgive me
for something I didn't even do.

357
00:26:11,997 --> 00:26:13,082
Transport is in there.

358
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:17,962
Is that blood, dude--

359
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:21,465
what the fuck?

360
00:26:39,024 --> 00:26:41,235
You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

361
00:26:43,571 --> 00:26:44,864
Oh, no, no. I'm not gonna look.

362
00:26:46,782 --> 00:26:47,950
Motherfucker!

363
00:26:55,624 --> 00:26:59,128
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's talk about this, okay?

364
00:26:59,211 --> 00:27:03,674
Even a dumbass like you is smart enough
to keep one in the... pipe.

365
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:06,218
Oh, shit.

366
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:08,178
And nighty night.

367
00:27:09,388 --> 00:27:12,016
- Darius Kincaid. Jesus Christ.
-...Michael.

368
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,101
This is who you want me to protect?
My shirt!

369
00:27:15,644 --> 00:27:16,562
Fine, fine.

370
00:27:17,313 --> 00:27:18,939
You get the feet, I'll get the nostrils.

371
00:27:20,316 --> 00:27:22,568
The <i>trial</i>
of former Belarusian president

372
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:25,988
<i>Vladislav dukhovich
took an uncertain turn this week,</i>

373
00:27:26,238 --> 00:27:27,489
<i>having recently survived</i>

374
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:31,285
<i>a dioxin poisoning attempt
that left his face disfigured.</i>

375
00:27:31,368 --> 00:27:34,455
<i>- Authorities are keeping dukhovich...
- Interpol wishes to</i> have a <i>word.</i>

376
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,041
Quite the dust-up in coventry
this morning.

377
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,460
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

378
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,965
You've come here to lodge a complaint?

379
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:48,218
I've come for my money.
I delivered as promised.

380
00:27:48,552 --> 00:27:51,055
I gave you Kincaid as exposed
as you'll ever get him.

381
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:53,098
Small security detail,

382
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:54,892
practically a rookie leading them.

383
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:58,062
I can't do more than that.
Let's be fair here.

384
00:28:08,364 --> 00:28:11,867
You think it's fair
that you want something for nothing?

385
00:28:12,326 --> 00:28:14,703
In my country...

386
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:17,665
...we would skin you like a cat.

387
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,292
Would that be fair?

388
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:26,840
I come from nothing. I work all my life...

389
00:28:27,257 --> 00:28:28,801
Serving the people.

390
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:32,012
And then they come into my country

391
00:28:32,096 --> 00:28:33,555
and they took it all away!

392
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:37,810
And now they lock me up like a rat,

393
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,812
feed me poison!

394
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:43,273
Is this fair?

395
00:28:44,483 --> 00:28:46,360
When Kincaid is dead,

396
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,864
you'll be paid in full.

397
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:55,285
You know he's a murderer, right?

398
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:56,829
You're playing nurse to a murderer.

399
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:58,497
- A witness. Mmm-hmm.
- Really?

400
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:00,207
Twenty-seven times.

401
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,627
That's how many times this asshole
has tried to kill me, 27-- 28!

402
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:05,295
Fucking Prague!

403
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,297
If dukhovich is acquitted,

404
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:09,258
he'll be back in power next week.

405
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,676
I won't let that happen.

406
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:11,677
Good.

407
00:29:12,136 --> 00:29:13,220
You should take him to the hague.

408
00:29:13,637 --> 00:29:14,596
I can't!

409
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,223
There's a mole inside interpol.

410
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:18,475
-It's already cost me 12 good officers.
- Good?

411
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:22,521
That's subjective.
Nice. Maybe they were nice.

412
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:26,650
I'll make it simple for you;
If I stay near him, they'll find him.

413
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:27,443
So I gotta risk my life
protecting this coffin magnet over here?

414
00:29:27,443 --> 00:29:27,526
So I gotta risk my life
protecting this coffin magnet over here?

415
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:29,403
So I gotta risk my life
protecting this coffin magnet over here?

416
00:29:29,486 --> 00:29:30,779
No, no, no. You gotta put something

417
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:32,114
-in the pot.
- How about your career?

418
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:33,991
- How about it?
- Your precious career.

419
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:35,492
You do this job for me,

420
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,746
and I'll get you back to elite status.

421
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:40,873
Yeah, you don't have that power.

422
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:42,833
I've got connections.

423
00:29:44,126 --> 00:29:45,794
You want back in? I can put you there.

424
00:29:45,878 --> 00:29:46,920
Why would I trust you?

425
00:29:49,131 --> 00:29:50,049
Why?

426
00:29:52,843 --> 00:29:54,595
Because I've never lied to you, Michael.

427
00:29:56,346 --> 00:29:59,266
You're terrible at almost everything,

428
00:30:00,642 --> 00:30:02,770
but you're good at keeping people alive.

429
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:05,606
Keep him alive... please,

430
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,901
and you get your dream life back.

431
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:12,571
And as bonus,
you'll never hear from me again.

432
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,367
Good.

433
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,707
Still.

434
00:30:34,134 --> 00:30:35,219
Where are you?

435
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:37,805
Setting up operation
at coventry police headquarters.

436
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:39,264
You got nothing from dukhovich?

437
00:30:39,348 --> 00:30:40,432
Are you surprised?

438
00:30:40,516 --> 00:30:41,350
- Ma'am?
- Busy.

439
00:30:41,433 --> 00:30:43,310
I've picked up activity
at our safe house in town.

440
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:45,020
Is this something
i need to know right now?

441
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:47,064
No, not normally.
But, yes, it should be vacant.

442
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:48,357
<i>And you believe it's not?</i>

443
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,275
<i>Well, the access code
was activated</i>

444
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,902
<i>without identity authorization.</i>

445
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:53,487
Could Kincaid have gotten inside?

446
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,114
But it's on a revolving encryption.

447
00:30:57,074 --> 00:30:58,492
Get a team over there. Now!

448
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:01,286
And where is agent roussel?

449
00:31:01,954 --> 00:31:03,080
<i>Sorry, got to go.</i>

450
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:04,081
Good luck.

451
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:13,549
I believe I know where Kincaid is.

452
00:31:42,452 --> 00:31:43,954
What the fuck is all this?

453
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:45,164
You're a fugitive.

454
00:31:45,622 --> 00:31:46,665
Fugitives wear restraints.

455
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:48,208
No, no, no, not the cuffs.

456
00:31:48,292 --> 00:31:51,128
I'm talking about these whack-ass,
hipster clothes I'm wearing.

457
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:52,546
Yeah, luckily I brought extra.

458
00:31:52,754 --> 00:31:54,173
Lucky for who?

459
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:57,426
Shit. Am I wearing underwear?

460
00:31:57,634 --> 00:32:00,137
Those are for me too,
in case I have to change your pants again.

461
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,471
Not a fan.

462
00:32:01,555 --> 00:32:03,724
You know they call them
swinging dicks for a reason.

463
00:32:04,183 --> 00:32:05,684
How about we never speak of this again?

464
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,358
Shit. Interpol protocol.

465
00:32:13,984 --> 00:32:17,196
When that phone rings and nobody answers,
they're gonna send officers to the door.

466
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:19,823
And there they are.

467
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,160
Yes, we're setting our perimeter.

468
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:26,538
Comfy?

469
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:28,498
So, what happened
to little miss interpol?

470
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:30,167
Agent roussel's gone.

471
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:33,629
Damn! I liked her. She's spunky.

472
00:32:34,296 --> 00:32:35,464
This building has two stairwells,

473
00:32:35,547 --> 00:32:36,757
-no fire escapes...
- No fire escapes

474
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,258
and no adjacent rooftops.

475
00:32:38,342 --> 00:32:40,677
You know, you're not the only
observant motherfucker on the planet.

476
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:41,929
I go through doors first.

477
00:32:42,012 --> 00:32:43,889
I check to see if it's clear,
then you follow.

478
00:32:43,972 --> 00:32:45,766
Really? You think that's necessary?

479
00:32:46,058 --> 00:32:50,020
- My job is to keep you out of harm's way.
- Shit, motherfucker.

480
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:52,856
I am harm's way.

481
00:33:07,496 --> 00:33:08,997
Two hostiles, maybe more.

482
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:10,832
I don't suppose I could have a gun?

483
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:13,085
No. We're gonna take
the north stairwell. Let's go.

484
00:33:14,378 --> 00:33:15,295
Fuck!

485
00:33:21,677 --> 00:33:23,387
- It's him!
- Come on!

486
00:33:31,895 --> 00:33:32,854
Thank god you're here.

487
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:34,481
I don't know
what I would've done without you.

488
00:33:34,982 --> 00:33:36,441
Well done. Guess what happens now?

489
00:33:37,192 --> 00:33:38,944
Shots fired! Shots fired!

490
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,627
<i>All units sending in nine-nine.</i>

491
00:33:59,923 --> 00:34:01,174
Now we have a new problem.

492
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:04,636
I like to keep things
a little more subtle.

493
00:34:15,063 --> 00:34:17,065
See? Boring is better.

494
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,488
Okay. That's very loud.

495
00:34:24,614 --> 00:34:25,657
It was empty anyway-

496
00:34:30,287 --> 00:34:32,456
<i>we're identifying
heat signatures on the rooftop</i>

497
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:33,874
<i>moving in a northbound direction.</i>

498
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:35,959
Copy that! Go, go, go!
They're on the roof!

499
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,339
No, no, no. No odds in thatjump.

500
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:42,591
It beats the hell out of whatever's
gonna come through that door.

501
00:34:42,674 --> 00:34:44,634
No. Just gotta...

502
00:34:45,844 --> 00:34:47,846
We just gotta find
a more intelligent way...

503
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:53,769
Motherfucker! Ahh! Shit!

504
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:57,189
Holy fucking shit.

505
00:34:57,272 --> 00:35:00,359
Secure the roof! Go, go, go!
Delta squad with me!

506
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:02,652
- They're on the north side!
- Copy that!

507
00:35:10,494 --> 00:35:12,120
Made that jump on one leg.

508
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:14,790
I made that jump
without jumping. Let's go.

509
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:16,375
So, what's your next trick,

510
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:18,627
showing me how we escape without escaping?

511
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,046
Let's just try to get to the car
without killing anyone, all right?

512
00:35:21,963 --> 00:35:24,716
- Ls this your car?
- One of them.

513
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,426
I remember
shooting at you in a Jaguar.

514
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,387
Buckle up. If we get
in a high-speed chase,

515
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,388
I want you strapped in.

516
00:35:29,471 --> 00:35:31,640
I'm more worried
about the wheels coming off this bitch

517
00:35:31,723 --> 00:35:33,725
when you reach the speed limit.

518
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,894
Back in the day,

519
00:35:35,977 --> 00:35:37,938
we wouldn't have even stolen
this piece of shit,

520
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:39,981
and we stole everything.
I remember one night--

521
00:35:40,065 --> 00:35:42,651
I know all I need to know about you.
All your early arrests,

522
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:45,695
your father in and out of prison,
you following in the same footsteps.

523
00:35:45,779 --> 00:35:48,031
Did your little research, did you?

524
00:35:48,573 --> 00:35:50,409
Prepare for a test,
there are no surprises.

525
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,370
And you grew up wanting to be a cop

526
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:55,455
till you found out
wasn't no money in that shit.

527
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:56,873
So you joined the CIA,
sharpened your skills,

528
00:35:56,873 --> 00:35:56,957
so you joined the CIA,
sharpened your skills,

529
00:35:56,957 --> 00:35:58,166
so you joined the CIA,
sharpened your skills,

530
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,960
then decided to open your own shop,

531
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,003
pimp yourself out to the fat cats.

532
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:04,881
I didn't even have to do
no research to know that shit.

533
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:06,925
It's written all over your punk-ass.

534
00:36:08,051 --> 00:36:10,637
Can't wait to hear what I'll do next.
That's great.

535
00:36:11,847 --> 00:36:12,806
You know, why don't...

536
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,351
Why don't you lay back
and keep from getting spotted.

537
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:17,269
Get comfortable.

538
00:36:17,352 --> 00:36:19,646
That's a good idea.

539
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:25,402
Smells like ass back here!

540
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,697
Bet that jag never smelled like ass.

541
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:31,575
These your electrolytes?

542
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:02,898
Facial recognition
identifies this man

543
00:37:02,981 --> 00:37:04,483
as Michael Bryce.

544
00:37:05,192 --> 00:37:07,319
But you already know that,
don't you, agent roussel?

545
00:37:08,278 --> 00:37:09,446
You two have a history.

546
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:11,531
Long time ago.

547
00:37:12,032 --> 00:37:13,825
You slipped Kincaid
into our own safe house,

548
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:15,076
then brought in this...

549
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:17,787
Executive protection agent?

550
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:24,753
Official channels had been compromised.
What did you expect me to do?

551
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:27,255
Clearly, our office security's
been breached.

552
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:30,717
The red notice stays.
You, however, can go.

553
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:32,344
I'm placing you on leave.

554
00:37:32,636 --> 00:37:34,930
You will surrender
your weapon and credentials.

555
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:37,015
You are going to be telling

556
00:37:37,098 --> 00:37:38,850
this story for years, Amelia,

557
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:41,228
from inside a very large office

558
00:37:42,229 --> 00:37:43,480
or a very small cell.

559
00:37:43,813 --> 00:37:46,775
Well, I like my odds.

560
00:37:48,193 --> 00:37:50,403
The only way Bryce and Kincaid
don't make it to the hague

561
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:52,322
is if they kill each other first.

562
00:37:54,282 --> 00:37:55,200
Amelia.

563
00:37:56,701 --> 00:37:58,036
She's making a mistake.

564
00:37:58,537 --> 00:38:00,080
We need to plug our leak.

565
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,208
Now, this Bryce, do you trust him?

566
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:05,418
With something like this, yes.

567
00:38:06,878 --> 00:38:07,963
I'll speak to casoria,

568
00:38:08,296 --> 00:38:10,549
get her to allow you to come
to the hague with us.

569
00:38:11,174 --> 00:38:12,676
But no more secrets.

570
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:15,095
Thank you, sir.

571
00:38:25,605 --> 00:38:27,941
Search for car, plate fj56mhv.

572
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:30,944
They'll have identified the car
with the traffic cams by now.

573
00:38:31,027 --> 00:38:33,446
And you. Welcome to fugitive life.

574
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:35,031
Until I turn you in.

575
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:37,325
Just need to find a different vehicle,

576
00:38:37,784 --> 00:38:40,662
older model, no alarm. Right here.

577
00:38:42,414 --> 00:38:44,249
Luckily, I came prepared.

578
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,754
You know, if you're gonna be a while,
i can just go in there and get a room.

579
00:38:50,297 --> 00:38:51,631
There's an art to low-impact,

580
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:55,010
high-efficiency
breaking and entering, but...

581
00:38:59,055 --> 00:39:00,056
Art's subjective.

582
00:39:01,182 --> 00:39:02,183
And you're bleeding again.

583
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:04,561
You know, for a dude
that runs around killing people,

584
00:39:04,644 --> 00:39:06,688
you've got this really strange
thing about bleeding.

585
00:39:06,771 --> 00:39:09,941
It's inefficient.
And I don't kill people, I protect them.

586
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:11,318
Hector Ramirez.

587
00:39:12,152 --> 00:39:15,071
Hector Ramirez was an assassin.

588
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:16,489
Yeah, I know. I trained him.

589
00:39:16,573 --> 00:39:18,491
Who was holding a knife
to my client's throat.

590
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:19,659
And you killed him.

591
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:22,162
No. I saved my client.

592
00:39:22,454 --> 00:39:24,581
I think Hector might have
a different perspective on that.

593
00:39:24,664 --> 00:39:26,583
Oh, is that so? Well, here's the thing.

594
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:28,752
I was a triple-a rated
executive protection agent.

595
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:31,254
- You just made up that triple-a shit.
- No, I did not!

596
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:33,214
And if guys like you--
if sociopaths like you

597
00:39:33,298 --> 00:39:36,051
weren't running around trying to kill
my clients, then no one would get hurt.

598
00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:38,553
Triple-a, yeah. It sounds like you ought
to be selling life insurance

599
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:40,013
or fixing my fucking transmission,
or something.

600
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:41,348
Well,
you're uninsurable, trust me.

601
00:39:41,431 --> 00:39:42,599
And you said "was."

602
00:39:42,682 --> 00:39:45,435
-"I was a triple-a, x-rated dickhead!"
- No, I said "am." Get in the fucking car!

603
00:39:45,518 --> 00:39:46,978
Get in the fucking car!

604
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,567
Jesus fucking Christ.

605
00:39:53,443 --> 00:39:55,487
You definitely said "was."

606
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:57,322
"Was" as in,

607
00:39:57,697 --> 00:40:00,659
"i used to be a triple-x
dickhead driving a jag,

608
00:40:00,742 --> 00:40:02,661
but now I'm rolling around
in this shit-wagon."

609
00:40:02,744 --> 00:40:04,037
Put your seatbelt on.

610
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,706
What happened? Lose your edge?

611
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:11,169
Drop focus? You slip up
and let a client get popped?

612
00:40:11,252 --> 00:40:12,295
Never slipped up.

613
00:40:13,171 --> 00:40:15,632
Well, how did "am" become "was"?

614
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:20,845
I don't actually know. I mean,
how does a so-called expert assassin

615
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:23,306
get busted by interpol?

616
00:40:23,598 --> 00:40:25,433
Love, baby. Straight-up love.

617
00:40:27,018 --> 00:40:29,604
<i>See, I'm doing
this job in Geneva, right?</i>

618
00:40:29,813 --> 00:40:31,606
<i>-- Some dude washing the wrong dude 's money.</i>

619
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,607
<i>I get a call.</i>

620
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:34,025
What?

621
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:35,527
<i>My wife's been in a car accident,</i>

622
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:36,611
- bad one.
- W hat?

623
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:39,864
<i>So, Geneva dude gets</i> a <i>pass,
i jet back to Mexico City,</i>

624
00:40:39,948 --> 00:40:42,701
<i>go straight to the hospital.
Bopped up in Sonia's room,</i>

625
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:44,994
<i>two dozen agents waiting for me.</i>

626
00:40:51,126 --> 00:40:52,085
Played by the heart.

627
00:40:52,877 --> 00:40:54,462
Happens to the best of us, man.

628
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:57,590
I mean, sort of like how
agent roussel took you from here

629
00:40:58,133 --> 00:41:00,343
to here... to here.

630
00:41:00,593 --> 00:41:03,722
Assassin and eavesdropper.
You're a real double threat.

631
00:41:04,431 --> 00:41:07,183
Well, you were whining like a bitch
so loud, I heard you through the wall.

632
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,185
Agent roussel and i
aren't any of your concern.

633
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:11,771
So, she dumped you because
of all your tight-assed,

634
00:41:12,355 --> 00:41:14,482
"boring is good, look before you leap,

635
00:41:14,566 --> 00:41:15,525
put your seatbelt on" shit?

636
00:41:15,608 --> 00:41:16,526
She didn't dump me.

637
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:19,446
Oh, motherfucker, I know she dumped you.

638
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:21,614
I'm just perusing all the reasons why,

639
00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:23,825
and there's a plethora
of those motherfuckers.

640
00:41:24,784 --> 00:41:26,411
- Plethora?
- Yeah. It means a lot.

641
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:29,164
I know what plethora means!
It just doesn't apply here!

642
00:41:30,457 --> 00:41:33,585
And not jumping off the top of a roof,
that's logical, that's safe.

643
00:41:33,668 --> 00:41:36,546
You know, wearing a seatbelt:
Logical, safe.

644
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:39,716
Let me ask you something,
how many times have you been shot?

645
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:41,676
- Counting today?
- Yeah.

646
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,345
- Too many to count. You?
- Yeah, I bet.

647
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:45,346
Zero.

648
00:41:45,597 --> 00:41:47,223
Now, we both know that's bullshit.

649
00:41:47,307 --> 00:41:50,560
That's not bullshit, okay?
This was a little flesh wound.

650
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:52,103
You just kind of zinged it right there.

651
00:41:52,187 --> 00:41:53,855
<i>Didn't even require a band-aid.
You got lucky.</i>

652
00:41:53,938 --> 00:41:56,900
<i>Yeah, the rock shifted
just as I took the shot.</i>

653
00:41:57,442 --> 00:41:59,194
<i>- You lucky motherfucker.</i>
- Fuck!

654
00:41:59,277 --> 00:42:00,195
Fuck!

655
00:42:00,779 --> 00:42:01,696
Fucking Prague.

656
00:42:02,697 --> 00:42:03,740
Yeah, Prague.

657
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:05,283
You never even took one for a client?

658
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:06,826
Nope. Never had to.

659
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,495
Yeah, but the question is, would you?

660
00:42:08,578 --> 00:42:10,246
See, if I'm paying triple-a rates,

661
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,957
then I'm looking
for that full-service shit,

662
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:13,958
you know what I'm saying?

663
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:16,127
That extra "a" stands for "ass,"

664
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:18,630
yours, between mine and a bullet.

665
00:42:18,713 --> 00:42:20,548
Being prepared for everything

666
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:22,342
means that that situation statistically
just won't occur.

667
00:42:22,425 --> 00:42:24,511
Bryce, you cannot be
prepared for everything!

668
00:42:24,594 --> 00:42:26,513
Life is gonna bloody us up, okay?

669
00:42:26,971 --> 00:42:29,557
You just gotta put a band-aid
on that shit and keep rolling!

670
00:42:30,725 --> 00:42:31,976
That's really beautiful, man.

671
00:42:32,393 --> 00:42:35,480
Do you ever just write stuff down?
I don't know, throw down a haiku or two?

672
00:43:24,487 --> 00:43:26,114
<i>-$ I saw the sign i
-.° nobody x</i>

673
00:43:26,197 --> 00:43:29,367
<i>-$ it opened up my eyes I saw the sign a'
-.° nobody, nobody, nobody r</i>

674
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,954
<i>-$ life is demanding i
-.° nobody gets out alive a'</i>

675
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:42,213
how'd you like that, motherfucker?

676
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:51,806
Do you have any idea how stupid you sound?

677
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,558
I mean, what a fuck-up!

678
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:56,352
You lost my husband, and you're like,

679
00:43:56,686 --> 00:43:59,022
"can you please help us find him?"

680
00:43:59,105 --> 00:44:00,857
Why the fuck should I?

681
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,610
That is your fucking job, motherfucker!

682
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:05,737
But, obviously, you suck at it.

683
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:12,535
You received
a phone call today from your attorney.

684
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:13,536
Sq?

685
00:44:14,245 --> 00:44:16,247
Well, we asked your attorney,

686
00:44:16,331 --> 00:44:19,167
but... he said he didn't have
any contact with you.

687
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:23,171
What? Are you fucking kidding me?

688
00:44:23,254 --> 00:44:26,049
Okay, that's it!
I've had it with this lawyer!

689
00:44:26,132 --> 00:44:29,552
He's an alcoholic.
He calls me completely drunk,

690
00:44:29,636 --> 00:44:32,347
and he starts saying
the most inappropriate things.

691
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,225
Like, for example,
what he likes to do to his wife's ass.

692
00:44:36,684 --> 00:44:40,396
That is a disgusting place
to hide a child's toy!

693
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,481
And you know what?

694
00:44:41,564 --> 00:44:43,566
I don't need to listen to this shit!

695
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:45,276
Then he forgets about it,

696
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,445
but I'm stuck with the images in my head!

697
00:44:47,528 --> 00:44:48,446
Mrs. Kincaid,

698
00:44:49,906 --> 00:44:51,491
if you know where your husband is,

699
00:44:51,574 --> 00:44:52,575
you need to tell us.

700
00:44:53,284 --> 00:44:54,410
It's for his own safety.

701
00:45:08,257 --> 00:45:12,929
I'm sorr-- you're worried
about my husband's safety?

702
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:18,101
No one in this world
can kill Darius Kincaid.

703
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:21,479
The man is a cucaracha,

704
00:45:22,313 --> 00:45:24,482
and I mean that
in every sense of the word.

705
00:45:25,066 --> 00:45:29,862
Sometimes you just want to crush
his little, filthy head with your shoe,

706
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:32,073
but he won't die.

707
00:45:32,365 --> 00:45:34,033
That motherfucker is unkillable,

708
00:45:34,242 --> 00:45:35,284
so you can relax.

709
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:38,997
But wait, no.

710
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:42,333
There is one important thing
that you should know.

711
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,301
Motherfuckers, get out of my fucking cell.

712
00:45:54,262 --> 00:45:55,638
Great.

713
00:45:56,222 --> 00:45:57,140
Now!

714
00:45:57,348 --> 00:45:59,225
And I want that lawyer fired!

715
00:45:59,308 --> 00:46:02,603
I want that lawyer fired!
I want a good one, professional lawyer!

716
00:46:02,687 --> 00:46:04,564
I have rights! Human rights!

717
00:46:12,238 --> 00:46:14,073
Okay, you can take a five-minute break.

718
00:46:31,174 --> 00:46:32,091
Good evening.

719
00:46:33,634 --> 00:46:34,635
Can I help you?

720
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:36,179
We need to see your cameras.

721
00:46:36,888 --> 00:46:39,307
Sorry, sir, that's for management only.

722
00:46:55,156 --> 00:46:56,074
<i>L</i> 90'! You!

723
00:47:01,245 --> 00:47:02,163
Where we at?

724
00:47:03,122 --> 00:47:04,123
I backtracked west.

725
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:06,375
West is the wrong direction.

726
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:08,544
Thank you. Thank you.

727
00:47:09,087 --> 00:47:10,755
They'd be expecting us
to take a direct route.

728
00:47:11,005 --> 00:47:12,173
The fuck is that you're eating?

729
00:47:12,256 --> 00:47:13,174
Postpones fatigue.

730
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:16,094
Refuels glycogen and electrolytes.
I got you one, too,

731
00:47:16,177 --> 00:47:18,262
while you were taking
one of your world-class naps.

732
00:47:18,346 --> 00:47:20,056
I'd stay awake if you let me drive.

733
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:22,100
Thank you. That's really generous of-- no!

734
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:25,728
I gotta piss.

735
00:47:26,145 --> 00:47:26,979
Use that.

736
00:47:27,063 --> 00:47:28,689
Timeline's not built for another break.

737
00:47:30,233 --> 00:47:33,528
Your dick might fit
in here, but mine...

738
00:47:34,862 --> 00:47:37,907
Plus, I need every drop of this shit
to tolerate this ride with you.

739
00:47:38,616 --> 00:47:39,700
Just pull the fucking car over.

740
00:47:40,535 --> 00:47:41,702
Jesus Christ.

741
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,922
It'd be a lot easier without these cuffs,

742
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:54,590
or this fucking underwear.

743
00:48:15,736 --> 00:48:16,654
Kincaid!

744
00:48:19,073 --> 00:48:20,908
Hey, asshole!

745
00:48:20,992 --> 00:48:23,953
Ugh! Fucking god damn it, that's not mud!

746
00:48:31,252 --> 00:48:32,378
You think I'm a fucking idiot?

747
00:48:33,045 --> 00:48:33,963
Well...

748
00:48:35,423 --> 00:48:37,466
You did think that cheap whiskey was piss.

749
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,801
Fuck!

750
00:48:40,261 --> 00:48:41,596
Where the hell did that come from?

751
00:48:41,846 --> 00:48:45,349
This is what happens
when you mess with a perfectly laid plan.

752
00:48:45,933 --> 00:48:48,644
- Give me a gun. Give me a goddamn gun!
- I got this! I got this!

753
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:53,357
There's more than one.

754
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:55,276
A-ha! Perfect deduction, Sherlock.

755
00:48:57,778 --> 00:48:59,530
Draw their fire so I can take a look.

756
00:48:59,822 --> 00:49:00,740
All right. Go!

757
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:04,827
Ow!

758
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:06,662
- Shit!
- Okay.

759
00:49:07,038 --> 00:49:09,832
Three shooters in a row, all lit up.

760
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:12,251
So, what do you want to do?

761
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:17,996
While you can't come up with a plan,
they're gonna kill us.

762
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,081
So here's the plan.

763
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:23,210
- What the fuck?
- You take eleven o'clock, I'll take one.

764
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,045
Let's see who gets to twelve first.

765
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,923
Okay. On three. You ready?

766
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,549
One...

767
00:49:38,207 --> 00:49:39,834
I said on three. You shot early.

768
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:41,085
Yeah, before they did.

769
00:49:41,293 --> 00:49:42,211
Let me break it down--

770
00:49:54,598 --> 00:49:57,685
so much for your intricately
calculated travel plans.

771
00:49:58,144 --> 00:49:59,937
That's why I was trying
to bounce on your ass.

772
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,230
See, I'm safer on my own.

773
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,065
There's no way that they could've known

774
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:05,401
-where we were.
- Well, they did, and now they're dead.

775
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:11,323
This yours? Ls this your cell phone?

776
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:13,742
I might've taken that off some dead merc.

777
00:50:14,076 --> 00:50:14,994
You might've...

778
00:50:15,578 --> 00:50:17,037
You know, they can track a cell phone.

779
00:50:17,663 --> 00:50:21,625
That's why I use a ghost chip in mine,
so they can't track the phone.

780
00:50:21,959 --> 00:50:23,878
I mean, that's how they know
where we were!

781
00:50:24,712 --> 00:50:26,797
Here I am, I'm plotting courses
all over the country,

782
00:50:26,881 --> 00:50:29,842
and you're carrying a location beacon
in your pocket!

783
00:50:30,801 --> 00:50:31,719
My bad.

784
00:50:32,011 --> 00:50:32,928
Your bad?

785
00:50:33,596 --> 00:50:36,640
You don't even understand how
21st century technology works! I mean,

786
00:50:36,724 --> 00:50:38,976
how have you stayed alive this long?

787
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:44,023
While all you guys are wasting your time
planning and aiming and deducing,

788
00:50:44,315 --> 00:50:45,316
I just do my thing,

789
00:50:45,649 --> 00:50:48,903
and my thing has always been better
than your fucking thing.

790
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:50,988
Great. There you go.

791
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:53,073
That's just great.

792
00:50:53,157 --> 00:50:55,576
I'm glad that your thing has
always been better than mine.

793
00:50:57,536 --> 00:50:58,662
You're not gonna take this gun?

794
00:50:58,746 --> 00:51:00,664
No, you keep that gun.
Use it to shoot me.

795
00:51:00,748 --> 00:51:02,541
No, no, no, I was gonna
shoot you with this--

796
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:04,543
shit!

797
00:51:14,386 --> 00:51:15,304
There go the guns.

798
00:51:15,971 --> 00:51:17,223
Well, look on the bright side.

799
00:51:18,224 --> 00:51:19,558
We get the bad guys' Van.

800
00:51:40,955 --> 00:51:42,540
This field smells like your car.

801
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,919
Dude, I said I was sorry about the phone.

802
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:49,213
Who knows, maybe
your plan would've worked.

803
00:51:51,382 --> 00:51:53,175
- So, what about your other plan?
- There's no plan!

804
00:51:53,259 --> 00:51:56,011
The plan is we're in a cow pasture,
that's the plan.

805
00:51:56,387 --> 00:51:58,556
I'm talking about your agent roussel plan.

806
00:51:59,014 --> 00:52:01,100
That's why you're doing this, right?
Get her back?

807
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:06,188
You think becoming
a triple-a card-carrying dickhead

808
00:52:06,272 --> 00:52:10,109
is gonna give you an all-access
backstage pass to agent roussel's ass,

809
00:52:10,442 --> 00:52:12,152
-and she'll fall in love.
- I get it.

810
00:52:12,236 --> 00:52:14,405
- You're gonna be the guy...
- And your life will have meaning again.

811
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:16,532
...that the other inmates come to
for advice. They're very lucky.

812
00:52:16,615 --> 00:52:18,826
Motherfucker, please.

813
00:52:19,493 --> 00:52:22,288
I've eaten hamburgers
that know more about women than you.

814
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:26,000
- You, my friend, are a romantic retard.
- Hey!

815
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:28,335
Just 'cause I want to get my business

816
00:52:28,419 --> 00:52:30,212
back in order, that doesn't make me
a shitty person.

817
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:34,717
And Amelia has nothing,
absolutely nothing, to do with this.

818
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:39,763
Oh man. You are so in love, it is crazy.

819
00:52:39,847 --> 00:52:41,390
Christ, do you ever shut up?

820
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:44,893
Why is everything always
about love with you?

821
00:52:45,394 --> 00:52:46,770
Well, what else is there?

822
00:52:47,438 --> 00:52:52,443
I mean, take away the guns, the money,
the travel, the perfect shot

823
00:52:52,526 --> 00:52:55,321
through a motherfucker's
earhole from 300 meters.

824
00:52:56,488 --> 00:52:59,325
I mean, none of that shit means dick
if I can't tell Sonia about it.

825
00:53:00,117 --> 00:53:02,328
Well, I guess Amelia's
just not as special as Sonia.

826
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:03,662
She sounds great.

827
00:53:04,413 --> 00:53:05,956
- What, she cheat on you?
- No.

828
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:08,042
- Try to kill you?
- No.

829
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:11,003
'Cause Sonia chopped off part of my ear
with a machete one time.

830
00:53:11,086 --> 00:53:12,963
She sewed it back on, but...

831
00:53:13,881 --> 00:53:16,425
It was two, three days before
our shit got real again.

832
00:53:17,509 --> 00:53:19,011
Where'd you guys meet, christianmingle?

833
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:20,638
No. A bar in Honduras.

834
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:24,850
One of those places
where nobody knows your face and name.

835
00:53:28,103 --> 00:53:29,271
<i>I'd just come off a job.</i>

836
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:32,566
<i>Some dude kidnapped
the wrong dude's daughter.</i>

837
00:53:34,401 --> 00:53:35,486
<i>I was sitting there chilling,</i>

838
00:53:35,778 --> 00:53:38,489
<i>when I noticed this waitress
getting hassled by these guys.</i>

839
00:53:43,327 --> 00:53:46,497
<i>I got up to help her, when she unleashed</i>

840
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:52,252
<i>the most amazing display
of violence and beauty</i>

841
00:53:52,961 --> 00:53:54,380
<i>I had ever seen.</i>

842
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,212
<i>When she severed that dude's
carotid artery with a beer bottle,</i>

843
00:54:35,879 --> 00:54:36,797
<i>I knew.</i>

844
00:54:37,881 --> 00:54:40,300
<i>I knew right then.</i>

845
00:54:58,736 --> 00:55:00,612
We slow danced all night.

846
00:55:08,912 --> 00:55:10,956
She sounds like she's gonna
make a good mother someday.

847
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:13,876
Lights.

848
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:19,590
Need a ride?

849
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,092
Yeah. We're trying to catch
a ferry to Amsterdam.

850
00:55:22,509 --> 00:55:23,761
- Yeah, I can get you there.
- Yeah?

851
00:55:23,844 --> 00:55:24,678
Jump in.

852
00:55:24,762 --> 00:55:27,556
Hey, hey, hey, there's eyes
all over Amsterdam for me.

853
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:28,682
That's where Sonia's locked up.

854
00:55:28,766 --> 00:55:30,726
It's a quick in and out.
I got a place there.

855
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:32,352
- You got a place in Amsterdam?
- Yeah.

856
00:55:32,853 --> 00:55:34,021
Is that where you keep the jag?

857
00:55:34,772 --> 00:55:36,523
You know what?
Why don't you go fuck yourself

858
00:55:36,607 --> 00:55:38,484
and the horse you-- hello.

859
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:43,197
Hello, beautiful sisters.

860
00:55:48,076 --> 00:55:49,286
Whose lap will I sit on'?

861
00:57:13,871 --> 00:57:14,788
One more!

862
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:26,133
Your stop, boys!

863
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:31,054
You take care, sisters.

864
00:57:31,805 --> 00:57:32,973
Bye, Kincaid!

865
00:57:35,434 --> 00:57:37,311
Go with god!

866
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:40,105
This man's killed over 150 people.

867
00:57:40,188 --> 00:57:41,440
Two-fifty, easy.

868
00:57:42,316 --> 00:57:43,317
Yeah, but they love you.

869
00:57:44,109 --> 00:57:45,861
Me, they want to perform an exorcism on.

870
00:57:46,862 --> 00:57:47,905
Question for a higher power.

871
00:57:49,281 --> 00:57:50,324
Who is more wicked,

872
00:57:51,116 --> 00:57:52,951
he who kills evil motherfuckers

873
00:57:53,702 --> 00:57:54,912
or he who protects them?

874
00:58:07,841 --> 00:58:09,343
You really believe you're the good guy?

875
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:19,394
My first contract... I was...

876
00:58:20,562 --> 00:58:21,980
I don't know, 16, 17.

877
00:58:23,607 --> 00:58:26,526
<i>There was a guy who broke into a church.</i>

878
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,572
<i>The preacher was still there,
so he told the guy,</i>

879
00:58:30,656 --> 00:58:33,450
<i>"look, you don't have to steal anything.
Take whatever you want."</i>

880
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:36,078
<i>Dude wasn't there for the loot.</i>

881
00:58:36,662 --> 00:58:37,746
<i>He wanted to hurt somebody.</i>

882
00:58:44,252 --> 00:58:45,087
<i>Slaughters the preacher,</i>

883
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:48,715
<i>displays his body on the altar
for his congregation to see.</i>

884
00:58:59,935 --> 00:59:03,355
<i>The Bible says never to take revenge,</i>

885
00:59:05,857 --> 00:59:06,942
<i>to leave it to the lord.</i>

886
00:59:10,612 --> 00:59:12,406
<i>But I wasn't prepared to wait that long.</i>

887
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:32,759
So, when your moral compass
gets around to pointing at me,

888
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,847
yeah, you'll be pointing
at one of the good guys.

889
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,183
And how does one
of the good guys get connected

890
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:41,601
with a piece of shit like dukhovich?

891
00:59:42,602 --> 00:59:44,104
I didn't know everything
the dude was into.

892
00:59:44,438 --> 00:59:45,397
That's an easy excuse.

893
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,649
Look, you know everything
about every client you ever had?

894
00:59:47,733 --> 00:59:50,819
Nope. I don't decide
whether my clients live or die.

895
01:00:25,812 --> 01:00:27,022
[Michael son of a bitch.

896
01:00:27,564 --> 01:00:29,107
Coitig oh, come on, come oh, come on.

897
01:00:29,191 --> 01:00:31,485
When's the last time you paid rent
on this safe house?

898
01:00:31,568 --> 01:00:34,279
I haven't done a lot
of Amsterdam jobs lately.

899
01:00:35,113 --> 01:00:36,364
I just need to get my gear.

900
01:00:36,448 --> 01:00:40,202
The problem is that...
All the windows are polycarb.

901
01:00:40,285 --> 01:00:42,913
They have... extra layers of laminate,

902
01:00:43,914 --> 01:00:45,540
and obviously there's
a hetzger alarm system,

903
01:00:45,624 --> 01:00:47,334
which is the premiere unit on the market.

904
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,836
It's got three fail-safes.

905
01:00:50,754 --> 01:00:53,215
But if I can just...

906
01:00:59,846 --> 01:01:00,931
What the...

907
01:01:01,306 --> 01:01:03,725
- Jesus Christ!
- Nope. Darius Kincaid.

908
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:07,646
But there are no words. I am amazing.

909
01:01:10,357 --> 01:01:11,858
That's so cute!

910
01:01:12,359 --> 01:01:13,902
You look so happy here.

911
01:01:17,114 --> 01:01:18,406
So, is agent roussel

912
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:20,617
the only photograph-worthy
girl in your life?

913
01:01:21,076 --> 01:01:22,077
Been busy working.

914
01:01:24,204 --> 01:01:25,413
Whoa!

915
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:27,541
You must give me your designer's number.

916
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,960
We got four hours to court,
let's get cleaned up.

917
01:01:30,043 --> 01:01:31,962
I need to change my bandage
and take a shower.

918
01:01:32,045 --> 01:01:33,588
The hot water still work in this bitch?

919
01:01:33,672 --> 01:01:34,589
Upstairs.

920
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:37,592
- Elevator?
- No!

921
01:01:37,676 --> 01:01:38,593
Fuck!

922
01:01:41,805 --> 01:01:43,557
Counsel, approach the bench.

923
01:01:44,432 --> 01:01:46,351
How can you allow Kincaid's testimony?

924
01:01:47,018 --> 01:01:49,563
A hired killer given a sweetheart deal.

925
01:01:50,313 --> 01:01:52,899
A man like that will say
anything to save himself.

926
01:01:52,983 --> 01:01:54,609
Kincaid has no sweetheart deal.

927
01:01:55,235 --> 01:01:56,862
His wife will go free, not him.

928
01:02:02,534 --> 01:02:03,952
The testimony will be allowed,

929
01:02:04,452 --> 01:02:07,038
assuming you produce
your witness by 5:00 P.M.

930
01:02:14,087 --> 01:02:16,506
- Michael, you should've been here by now.
- Yeah. Just a couple of bumps.

931
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:17,424
We're on our way.

932
01:02:17,507 --> 01:02:19,009
<i>The judge isn't giving us any wiggle room.</i>

933
01:02:19,092 --> 01:02:20,760
You have less than four hours now!

934
01:02:21,428 --> 01:02:23,013
<i>Well, we're gonna be there in half that.</i>

935
01:02:23,972 --> 01:02:25,056
Then why are you calling me?

936
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:28,435
Right. Well...

937
01:02:31,229 --> 01:02:33,607
I'm calling you because
I've been thinking, and...

938
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:38,987
I forgive you.

939
01:02:42,782 --> 01:02:43,700
Yeah.

940
01:02:45,035 --> 01:02:46,119
It feels good to say that.

941
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:50,540
I forgive you, Amelia.

942
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:53,919
Are you fucking kidding me'?

943
01:02:54,294 --> 01:02:55,212
What?

944
01:02:55,503 --> 01:02:57,005
You're seriously doing this now?

945
01:02:57,255 --> 01:02:59,174
<i>- No. What?
- And forgive me for what?</i>

946
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:02,385
- There's nothing to forgive!
- No, no, no, look, I thought that you...

947
01:03:02,469 --> 01:03:05,305
- Just get Kincaid here!
- Fucking prick!

948
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:17,776
Darius?

949
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:29,537
Fuck!

950
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:36,169
Yeah. We've got the whole area covered.

951
01:03:36,711 --> 01:03:38,505
If Kincaid shows up, he's ours.

952
01:03:42,884 --> 01:03:43,802
<i>Stay alert.</i>

953
01:03:44,094 --> 01:03:45,011
Copy that.

954
01:04:13,999 --> 01:04:15,083
Yeah, tulips.

955
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:17,752
That will be 25.

956
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:09,763
Easy_

957
01:06:00,397 --> 01:06:01,981
<i>ay, mi cucaracha.</i>

958
01:06:10,782 --> 01:06:12,492
Couldn't you just had
the flowers delivered?

959
01:06:14,327 --> 01:06:15,620
Needed a personal touch.

960
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:17,330
You were about to get
his personal touch,

961
01:06:17,414 --> 01:06:18,331
if I hadn't followed you.

962
01:06:18,415 --> 01:06:19,332
All right, I appreciate you.

963
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:21,376
And the guys who started
tracking you a few blocks ago.

964
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:23,211
You mean the guy you snatched in the bush,

965
01:06:23,294 --> 01:06:24,838
and the two you left
knocked out in the park?

966
01:06:25,547 --> 01:06:27,465
Like I said, I appreciate you.

967
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:30,135
Okay, so if you knew
that they were out there,

968
01:06:30,218 --> 01:06:32,804
but you still felt it was important
to deliver these flowers?

969
01:06:34,347 --> 01:06:36,182
Sonia's gonna really love those flowers.

970
01:06:36,266 --> 01:06:37,934
I sure fucking hope so.

971
01:06:38,017 --> 01:06:40,395
Now, this is as close
as I'm gonna be to her

972
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:41,855
for a very long time.

973
01:06:43,148 --> 01:06:44,566
It had to be special.

974
01:06:46,985 --> 01:06:47,902
First.

975
01:06:49,237 --> 01:06:51,781
I'm first. Look... you were saying?

976
01:06:52,657 --> 01:06:53,575
Tell me something.

977
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:55,368
The day you and agent roussel

978
01:06:55,452 --> 01:06:57,120
took that picture I saw in your place,

979
01:06:57,495 --> 01:06:59,998
what kind of things would you have done
for her to make her happy?

980
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:03,460
Anything. I loved her. Trusted her.

981
01:07:04,461 --> 01:07:06,337
She sold me out. Case closed.

982
01:07:06,588 --> 01:07:10,675
Well, that's cold. Maybe, just maybe,

983
01:07:11,384 --> 01:07:12,886
you ought to give her a pass on this.

984
01:07:13,761 --> 01:07:15,597
I mean, I gotta tell you, honestly,

985
01:07:16,473 --> 01:07:18,808
there's not a lot of women
who'd put up with your shit.

986
01:07:19,809 --> 01:07:21,102
That's inspirational, thank you.

987
01:07:21,186 --> 01:07:23,771
What I meant to say:
There's no women who would put up with it.

988
01:07:24,147 --> 01:07:25,565
- That's better.
- You're an annoying motherfucker

989
01:07:25,648 --> 01:07:26,774
with all your rules and shit.

990
01:07:26,858 --> 01:07:30,028
I mean, if she can put up with that,
she must be a pretty special girl.

991
01:07:32,739 --> 01:07:33,656
She is.

992
01:07:35,492 --> 01:07:37,494
You know, I told her today
that I forgave her.

993
01:07:37,827 --> 01:07:40,830
Really? And how'd that go?

994
01:07:41,247 --> 01:07:42,165
Hard to tell.

995
01:07:42,457 --> 01:07:44,751
You know, women don't like
to be forgiven for shit

996
01:07:45,168 --> 01:07:47,378
'cause that implies they did
some shit to begin with.

997
01:07:49,297 --> 01:07:50,924
I should just forget about kurosawa.

998
01:07:51,466 --> 01:07:53,384
- W hat?
- Takashi kurosawa.

999
01:07:54,886 --> 01:07:57,722
He was my client, she exposed him,
and he got killed.

1000
01:08:02,977 --> 01:08:03,895
Something funny?

1001
01:08:05,813 --> 01:08:08,274
She didn't expose your client!

1002
01:08:08,358 --> 01:08:09,943
I popped kurosawa!

1003
01:08:11,611 --> 01:08:13,613
<i>I was at the airport for another target.</i>

1004
01:08:13,696 --> 01:08:15,073
<i>I spotted him by accident.</i>

1005
01:08:15,281 --> 01:08:17,617
<i>Lucky for me. Him, not so much.</i>

1006
01:08:18,368 --> 01:08:20,578
<i>Doubled my money
on that corrupt Asian motherfucker.</i>

1007
01:08:20,912 --> 01:08:26,459
<i>The single most awesome shot
I've made in my entire hitman career.</i>

1008
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:31,339
<i>Three hundred meters through a firm,
c-cup tittie-sized window.</i>

1009
01:08:33,925 --> 01:08:36,553
Hey, I thought you knew
i was the one who popped him.

1010
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,437
'Zzz

1011
01:08:48,648 --> 01:08:51,859
- shit! What the fuck, Bryce! Mother--
- we're done!

1012
01:08:51,943 --> 01:08:53,528
That shit was two years ago, man.

1013
01:08:53,611 --> 01:08:55,071
You gonna be a little bitch about it?

1014
01:08:55,154 --> 01:08:56,030
You're on your own!

1015
01:08:56,114 --> 01:08:58,283
Well, good! I'll be safer on my own!

1016
01:08:58,366 --> 01:09:00,868
You won't last one hour without me!
You'll be dead in a minute!

1017
01:09:00,952 --> 01:09:03,913
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're about as useful
as a condom in a convent.

1018
01:09:04,205 --> 01:09:06,666
- Eat my ass!
- That's what she said!

1019
01:09:06,749 --> 01:09:09,294
- Suck it! Suck it!
- Fuck you!

1020
01:09:10,044 --> 01:09:11,462
Fucking pussy-

1021
01:09:23,016 --> 01:09:23,850
fuck!

1022
01:09:32,191 --> 01:09:35,236
Do you have any idea how prepared I was?

1023
01:09:36,404 --> 01:09:37,405
No, not really.

1024
01:09:37,989 --> 01:09:40,533
No. Every possible scenario
i had covered, every kill shot,

1025
01:09:40,992 --> 01:09:42,994
every... every angle.

1026
01:09:48,041 --> 01:09:50,960
And he fucking ruins my life
with one lucky shot

1027
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:52,462
through a window the size of a...

1028
01:09:53,338 --> 01:09:54,255
Just a...

1029
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:04,265
There he goes again.

1030
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:09,395
Shots fired! Shots fired!

1031
01:10:09,854 --> 01:10:11,314
I hope they kill him. I really do.

1032
01:10:12,023 --> 01:10:12,940
Okay.

1033
01:10:16,736 --> 01:10:20,239
Even if I did save him, again,
you know what he'd say?

1034
01:10:20,323 --> 01:10:22,492
He'd say, "i had it all
figured out before you got here."

1035
01:10:26,746 --> 01:10:28,206
He'd say, "i guess my thing

1036
01:10:28,289 --> 01:10:30,333
just better than your thing,
motherfucker."

1037
01:10:33,586 --> 01:10:36,214
"I guess bullets are just allergic
to me, motherfucker."

1038
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:42,095
This guy singlehandedly ruined
the word "motherfucker."

1039
01:10:42,178 --> 01:10:43,805
Do you know how hard that is to do?

1040
01:10:46,766 --> 01:10:49,477
I was triple-a rated executive protection.

1041
01:10:53,314 --> 01:10:54,315
I was up here.

1042
01:10:56,693 --> 01:10:57,652
I was up here.

1043
01:10:59,278 --> 01:11:00,530
And god damn it!

1044
01:11:04,534 --> 01:11:05,702
Pass me the magazine.

1045
01:11:17,839 --> 01:11:18,798
There he is!

1046
01:11:31,728 --> 01:11:32,979
Hi.

1047
01:12:12,935 --> 01:12:14,645
Requesting all units, heading south!

1048
01:12:17,565 --> 01:12:18,775
Shoot him!

1049
01:12:19,609 --> 01:12:21,110
Under the bridge! On your right!

1050
01:12:34,373 --> 01:12:35,291
Sorry.

1051
01:12:38,878 --> 01:12:42,298
Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

1052
01:12:42,548 --> 01:12:43,925
God damn it!

1053
01:13:01,567 --> 01:13:02,819
Who are these guys?

1054
01:13:04,654 --> 01:13:05,905
Go, go, go, go, go!

1055
01:13:07,073 --> 01:13:08,115
Turn!

1056
01:13:32,765 --> 01:13:34,141
He's getting away!

1057
01:13:56,747 --> 01:13:57,748
Watch out!

1058
01:14:04,755 --> 01:14:06,048
To the right!

1059
01:14:10,136 --> 01:14:12,179
- Drop your weapon!
- This way!

1060
01:14:15,099 --> 01:14:16,017
Fuck!

1061
01:14:17,435 --> 01:14:19,020
Hey, interpol! Interpol!

1062
01:14:25,776 --> 01:14:26,694
Fuck!

1063
01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:35,536
Shit!

1064
01:15:05,691 --> 01:15:06,776
Hurry!

1065
01:15:39,922 --> 01:15:41,089
Fuck!

1066
01:16:23,488 --> 01:16:24,406
Fuck!

1067
01:16:53,685 --> 01:16:54,728
Okay.

1068
01:17:03,654 --> 01:17:05,906
A loose helmet
is like wearing no helmet at all.

1069
01:17:06,907 --> 01:17:09,576
It's not a button strap. It's a d-ring.

1070
01:17:10,035 --> 01:17:12,663
Just unthread it through
the thing. It's very simple.

1071
01:17:13,413 --> 01:17:16,208
Well... or there's--
there's that shortcut.

1072
01:17:31,807 --> 01:17:34,893
I ask you one time, polite.

1073
01:17:35,602 --> 01:17:38,063
Where is Kincaid?

1074
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:42,359
Honestly, I'd tell you if I knew.

1075
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:45,946
You have my word. Look at my right hand.

1076
01:17:46,989 --> 01:17:49,199
See that? That's a boy scout salute.

1077
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:51,159
We're sworn to never lie.

1078
01:17:51,243 --> 01:17:52,869
I've taken an oath, so you can trust--

1079
01:17:53,662 --> 01:17:56,540
right in the fucking ear!

1080
01:17:59,584 --> 01:18:00,961
Really? Waterboarding? Really?

1081
01:18:01,837 --> 01:18:04,006
I was in the CIA. You know,
we don't do that anymore.

1082
01:18:06,258 --> 01:18:08,719
Okay. Hey, hey. Hold it.
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

1083
01:18:08,969 --> 01:18:11,221
Here's what we learned.
The key to interrogation

1084
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:12,681
is establishing a bond

1085
01:18:13,098 --> 01:18:15,517
between the interrogator
and the subject, okay?

1086
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,186
You know, just sort of
like a rapport, okay?

1087
01:18:18,270 --> 01:18:22,107
You need me to like you.
You need me to like you, okay?

1088
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:23,817
You need me to like you!

1089
01:18:34,244 --> 01:18:35,495
I really don't like you.

1090
01:18:37,205 --> 01:18:38,665
Okay, okay, okay-

1091
01:18:47,674 --> 01:18:49,301
where is Kincaid?

1092
01:18:49,801 --> 01:18:51,970
He's right behind you.
Scout's honor.

1093
01:19:22,959 --> 01:19:23,794
[9unshofl

1094
01:19:36,681 --> 01:19:38,558
[9unshofl

1095
01:19:44,272 --> 01:19:45,315
[9unshofl

1096
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:49,277
oh, my god!

1097
01:20:18,306 --> 01:20:19,224
Fuck!

1098
01:20:19,975 --> 01:20:22,602
Hey, listen, before you start talking,

1099
01:20:22,686 --> 01:20:24,938
'cause I know you're gonna
start fucking talking,

1100
01:20:26,106 --> 01:20:29,734
I just want to apologize
for laughing about popping kurosawa.

1101
01:20:30,235 --> 01:20:32,571
I know that shit
cost you your girl and that...

1102
01:20:33,321 --> 01:20:35,115
Fake-ass, made-up triple-a shit

1103
01:20:35,198 --> 01:20:36,491
-you keep talking about.
- No, no, no...

1104
01:20:36,575 --> 01:20:37,701
No, it was all my fault.

1105
01:20:39,077 --> 01:20:42,706
No... I did it all to myself.

1106
01:20:42,789 --> 01:20:45,000
Bryce, please! Come on,
you didn't do it to yourself.

1107
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,835
That's life. Life happens.

1108
01:20:47,335 --> 01:20:48,628
Life without Amelia.

1109
01:20:50,964 --> 01:20:53,383
Hey, still time to work that shit out.

1110
01:20:55,969 --> 01:20:57,679
So, how'd you and agent roussel meet?

1111
01:21:01,433 --> 01:21:02,350
On a job.

1112
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:05,145
She was...

1113
01:21:07,022 --> 01:21:08,899
She was working an undercover op,

1114
01:21:10,358 --> 01:21:11,276
very badly.

1115
01:21:13,195 --> 01:21:15,780
<i>I was at a client's funeral.
Massive heart attack.</i>

1116
01:21:16,406 --> 01:21:18,325
<i>I can protect someone
from bullets and explosives,</i>

1117
01:21:18,575 --> 01:21:22,120
<i>but there's nothing I can do
against indiscriminate use of mayonnaise</i>

1118
01:21:22,204 --> 01:21:23,497
<i>for 68 straight years.</i>

1119
01:21:24,706 --> 01:21:26,166
<i>Technically, I was still on the payroll,</i>

1120
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:28,460
<i>so I was in the building,
paying my respects.</i>

1121
01:21:36,426 --> 01:21:38,803
<i>Amelia was there
with some of her other interpol agents.</i>

1122
01:21:39,012 --> 01:21:42,140
<i>They were hoping to bust my client's
shady and mayonnaise-chugging brother.</i>

1123
01:21:42,516 --> 01:21:47,187
<i>Instead of doing things nice and quiet,
they got marked, and their target runs.</i>

1124
01:21:47,729 --> 01:21:48,647
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1125
01:21:49,022 --> 01:21:51,149
<i>Leave it to interpol to turn
a really fun funeral</i>

1126
01:21:51,233 --> 01:21:52,567
<i>with lots of delicious hors d'oeuvres</i>

1127
01:21:52,776 --> 01:21:55,612
<i>into a depressing carnival show
of total unprofessionalism.</i>

1128
01:22:36,778 --> 01:22:38,071
Just kind of bumped into her.

1129
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:43,285
See, that's what I'm talking about.

1130
01:22:43,994 --> 01:22:44,995
It just happened!

1131
01:22:45,662 --> 01:22:47,455
You didn't plan it, deduce it,

1132
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:49,833
or Google running
into the girl of your dreams.

1133
01:22:49,916 --> 01:22:51,293
You just bumped into her,

1134
01:22:51,376 --> 01:22:53,378
the same way I just bumped into kurosawa.

1135
01:22:53,795 --> 01:22:55,380
You know, when life gives you shit,

1136
01:22:56,464 --> 01:22:57,382
you make kool-aid.

1137
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:02,470
That's not really
how that expression works.

1138
01:23:02,554 --> 01:23:05,557
Yeah, and that's the beauty
of that motherfucker: Life.

1139
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,892
Ah. Yeah, well, life, I mean...

1140
01:23:07,976 --> 01:23:11,354
Life doesn't usually give you shit,
and then turn into a beverage.

1141
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:14,482
That's not... at least
where I'm from, that's not how it works.

1142
01:23:14,566 --> 01:23:16,067
Look, motherfucker,
you don't have to explain

1143
01:23:16,151 --> 01:23:18,612
-every goddamn thing that goes on in life!
- If it gives you lemons...

1144
01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:20,322
Okay? You don't need a reason
for that shit.

1145
01:23:20,405 --> 01:23:21,239
...you would make lemonade.

1146
01:23:21,323 --> 01:23:22,866
Just shut the fuck up!

1147
01:23:28,246 --> 01:23:29,372
It just doesn't work that way.

1148
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,180
Breaking news from the hague

1149
01:23:45,263 --> 01:23:47,390
<i>suggests that if a credible witness
cannot be produced</i>

1150
01:23:47,474 --> 01:23:48,433
<i>within the next hour,</i>

1151
01:23:49,017 --> 01:23:51,645
<i>the former president of Belarus,
Vladislav dukhovich,</i>

1152
01:23:51,728 --> 01:23:53,396
<i>will walk free and resume power.</i>

1153
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:57,776
<i>This would be a spectacular embarrassment
for the international community</i>

1154
01:23:58,401 --> 01:24:00,654
<i>and a crushing blow
for the many relatives...</i>

1155
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:07,077
They're out there,

1156
01:24:09,287 --> 01:24:11,122
waiting for us to make the first move.

1157
01:24:11,956 --> 01:24:13,291
I know I would be.

1158
01:24:14,542 --> 01:24:15,669
I should've told Amelia.

1159
01:24:16,127 --> 01:24:17,045
Told her what?

1160
01:24:17,879 --> 01:24:19,089
That I'm a stupid man.

1161
01:24:23,593 --> 01:24:27,097
Hey... what if I told you
i couldn't protect you?

1162
01:24:27,389 --> 01:24:28,390
I'd say you're right.

1163
01:24:29,766 --> 01:24:32,435
We'll just go to Amsterdam,
I'll help you get Sonia out,

1164
01:24:33,853 --> 01:24:35,355
and you give her those flowers in person.

1165
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:36,898
No fucking way.

1166
01:24:38,024 --> 01:24:40,568
I gotta help you get back
that triple-a shit I fucked up.

1167
01:24:40,652 --> 01:24:41,861
Guilt's killing me.

1168
01:24:42,904 --> 01:24:45,407
Dukhovich, that motherfucker's gotta go.

1169
01:24:46,324 --> 01:24:47,951
Well, it's not gonna happen
unless we get there.

1170
01:24:48,618 --> 01:24:49,577
Shit, I'd bet on them.

1171
01:24:50,078 --> 01:24:51,162
Normally I would, too.

1172
01:24:51,246 --> 01:24:52,372
I got a hot tip.

1173
01:24:52,455 --> 01:24:53,873
There's a couple of ringers in the game.

1174
01:24:54,874 --> 01:24:56,084
We got our choice of wheels.

1175
01:25:00,672 --> 01:25:01,965
That's a good-looking jag.

1176
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,634
Yeah. I guarantee
you if that smells like ass,

1177
01:25:04,718 --> 01:25:06,052
it's supermodel ass.

1178
01:25:12,392 --> 01:25:14,310
- Really?
- Oh yeah.

1179
01:25:14,769 --> 01:25:15,729
She blends right in.

1180
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:37,584
- Whoa!
- Fuck!

1181
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:38,877
That's responsive!

1182
01:25:40,253 --> 01:25:43,465
Jesus. No! I have-- I have a pen knife.

1183
01:25:44,424 --> 01:25:46,676
It's just that the gearshift's
on the right-hand side here,

1184
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,428
and I'm not used to that.
It's practically impossible...

1185
01:25:48,511 --> 01:25:49,971
Get out of the fucking car.

1186
01:25:50,054 --> 01:25:51,806
A three-day adjustment period
to figure this out.

1187
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:54,350
- I will bust a cap in your ass,
- the clutch--

1188
01:25:54,434 --> 01:25:55,685
if you don't give up that wheel.

1189
01:25:55,769 --> 01:25:56,895
Have you ever said please

1190
01:25:56,978 --> 01:25:57,979
-or thank you...
- Please, motherfucker!

1191
01:25:58,062 --> 01:25:59,355
Why are we always yelling?

1192
01:25:59,439 --> 01:26:00,690
- Get out of the fucking car!
- Fine!

1193
01:26:05,111 --> 01:26:06,362
Time's just about up.

1194
01:26:08,448 --> 01:26:11,326
No sign. They vanished in Amsterdam.

1195
01:26:11,409 --> 01:26:12,619
Dukhovich is free.

1196
01:26:13,077 --> 01:26:14,329
Michael would never let that happen.

1197
01:26:14,412 --> 01:26:16,831
It appears you're wrong
about your Michael Bryce.

1198
01:26:29,177 --> 01:26:30,261
Hello?

1199
01:26:30,345 --> 01:26:31,387
Hey.

1200
01:26:31,471 --> 01:26:32,388
Michael, where are you?

1201
01:26:32,472 --> 01:26:33,765
We're a couple minutes out.

1202
01:26:37,268 --> 01:26:38,186
Look“.

1203
01:26:39,103 --> 01:26:40,396
I wanna tell you that I'm sorry.

1204
01:26:42,607 --> 01:26:45,443
I wanna say that I'm sorry
for, um, for everything.

1205
01:26:45,527 --> 01:26:48,154
For kurosawa, us, it's all my fault.

1206
01:26:48,238 --> 01:26:49,656
You know, I act like a...

1207
01:26:50,615 --> 01:26:52,534
I act like a fucking child around you.

1208
01:26:52,617 --> 01:26:54,953
<i>I can't admit that it's my fault,
and I project that onto you,</i>

1209
01:26:55,036 --> 01:26:56,538
<i>and, you know, that's not fair.</i>

1210
01:26:56,955 --> 01:26:58,122
You deserve better than that.

1211
01:27:02,836 --> 01:27:04,295
Why are you telling me this now?

1212
01:27:04,379 --> 01:27:07,340
Well, under the circumstances,
it seemed like a good time.

1213
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:08,591
We got company.

1214
01:27:08,675 --> 01:27:09,676
Huh?

1215
01:27:17,809 --> 01:27:18,726
Let's go!

1216
01:27:28,278 --> 01:27:29,279
Amelia.

1217
01:27:34,075 --> 01:27:34,993
Amelia.

1218
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,873
Just want to say that...

1219
01:27:39,956 --> 01:27:43,793
L"love".You.

1220
01:27:54,178 --> 01:27:56,681
Jesus Christ! Really?

1221
01:27:56,764 --> 01:27:58,224
What happened to the seatbelt rule?

1222
01:28:07,859 --> 01:28:08,818
Fuck!

1223
01:28:11,696 --> 01:28:13,990
- Look--
- move your fucking car!

1224
01:28:14,073 --> 01:28:15,199
Hurry! Over here!

1225
01:28:39,057 --> 01:28:39,974
<i>Michael?</i>

1226
01:28:40,516 --> 01:28:42,268
<i>- Michael?</i>
- W <i>ho this?</i>

1227
01:28:42,477 --> 01:28:43,311
<i>Hello?</i>

1228
01:28:43,394 --> 01:28:46,356
Agent roussel, hold on,
let me put you on speaker.

1229
01:28:47,190 --> 01:28:48,191
What happened to Michael?

1230
01:28:48,566 --> 01:28:49,484
He had to bounce.

1231
01:28:52,487 --> 01:28:53,821
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Hey!

1232
01:28:58,284 --> 01:28:59,535
You know, he really cares about you.

1233
01:29:01,371 --> 01:29:03,539
He has a hard time
processing emotions and shit.

1234
01:29:13,716 --> 01:29:15,927
But one thing his fucked-up
brain has figured out,

1235
01:29:16,344 --> 01:29:17,553
is he really loves you.

1236
01:29:26,562 --> 01:29:27,814
Are you in the middle of something?

1237
01:29:27,897 --> 01:29:29,440
Well, actually, yeah, I am.

1238
01:29:29,524 --> 01:29:30,900
Look, we'll call you back.

1239
01:30:15,445 --> 01:30:17,530
Follow me, hurry! Pass me the magazine.

1240
01:31:06,954 --> 01:31:07,914
Watch out!

1241
01:32:04,887 --> 01:32:06,472
Okay, gentlemen...

1242
01:33:01,777 --> 01:33:02,945
Fuck!

1243
01:34:20,523 --> 01:34:21,732
If you wouldn't mind...

1244
01:34:23,276 --> 01:34:24,193
The gun.

1245
01:34:26,237 --> 01:34:28,155
Yes.

1246
01:34:51,971 --> 01:34:52,888
Thank you.

1247
01:34:56,892 --> 01:35:00,771
Yo! You about done?
Tick took, motherfucker!

1248
01:35:03,232 --> 01:35:05,067
He's fucking unkillable.

1249
01:35:05,609 --> 01:35:06,861
Fuck.

1250
01:35:07,945 --> 01:35:09,488
<i>With just
five minutes remaining</i>

1251
01:35:09,572 --> 01:35:10,656
<i>before the court's deadline,</i>

1252
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:14,160
<i>the case against Vladislav dukhovich
is almost certainly doomed.</i>

1253
01:35:22,626 --> 01:35:24,086
Suspicious vehicle
is approaching, commander.

1254
01:35:24,295 --> 01:35:25,421
Stop the car!

1255
01:35:29,050 --> 01:35:29,967
What's going on here?

1256
01:35:33,596 --> 01:35:35,014
Is this what we've been waiting for?

1257
01:35:37,933 --> 01:35:38,851
Shit.

1258
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:49,862
I got your witness, Darius Kincaid.

1259
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:52,198
Follow me.

1260
01:35:56,035 --> 01:35:57,328
Obviously, your honor,

1261
01:35:57,411 --> 01:36:01,082
this has devolved into a complete waste
of my client's time.

1262
01:36:01,457 --> 01:36:03,417
The prosecution has no witness to present.

1263
01:36:06,462 --> 01:36:08,005
Can you empty
your pockets, please, sir.

1264
01:36:14,553 --> 01:36:16,138
Are you kidding me? Come on!

1265
01:36:20,059 --> 01:36:22,186
As we seem to be reaching our deadline,

1266
01:36:22,269 --> 01:36:26,857
I have no choice but to declare
that this trial has come to its natural...

1267
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:39,328
Your honor, I present Darius Kincaid.

1268
01:36:39,412 --> 01:36:40,913
The deadline has passed!

1269
01:36:40,996 --> 01:36:44,333
I believe we still had
a few seconds on the clock.

1270
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:46,877
How do I look?

1271
01:36:47,169 --> 01:36:48,963
You got a little speck of blood on your...

1272
01:36:50,172 --> 01:36:51,090
Everywhere.

1273
01:36:52,133 --> 01:36:54,552
Will the prosecution
please prepare their witness.

1274
01:36:54,635 --> 01:36:56,220
- Hi.
- My god, are you okay?

1275
01:36:56,637 --> 01:36:59,140
Yeah. There's your guy.

1276
01:37:00,975 --> 01:37:02,685
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1277
01:37:04,437 --> 01:37:05,521
By the way, bumping into you

1278
01:37:05,604 --> 01:37:07,231
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1279
01:37:14,196 --> 01:37:16,157
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1280
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:17,324
and nothing but the truth?

1281
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:19,076
Yeah.

1282
01:37:21,203 --> 01:37:23,372
Your name is Darius Kincaid?

1283
01:37:23,956 --> 01:37:27,334
No. My real name is Darius Evans.

1284
01:37:28,252 --> 01:37:29,879
My parents separated when I was six.

1285
01:37:30,212 --> 01:37:32,715
My mother remarried
a real mean piece of work

1286
01:37:33,215 --> 01:37:34,884
named Roger Kincaid.

1287
01:37:35,259 --> 01:37:36,927
She figured if I took his name,

1288
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:38,971
he'd keep his belt on more often.

1289
01:37:39,346 --> 01:37:41,223
Plan didn't work so well,
but the name stuck.

1290
01:37:41,932 --> 01:37:45,311
My real father's name
is Maurice Evans, preacher.

1291
01:37:45,811 --> 01:37:47,938
He was killed a few years later
in his own church.

1292
01:37:48,856 --> 01:37:49,773
I'm sorry, I didn't...

1293
01:37:49,857 --> 01:37:52,026
That's all right.
Can't research everything.

1294
01:37:52,359 --> 01:37:56,739
Mr. Kincaid, were you ever
in the employ of Vladislav dukhovich?

1295
01:37:58,491 --> 01:38:00,576
No.
Have you ever met dukhovich?

1296
01:38:01,368 --> 01:38:05,456
Yes. April 17, 2012,
he invited me to his palace.

1297
01:38:07,124 --> 01:38:10,377
<i>Prosecution exhibit
17-d, palace security logs.</i>

1298
01:38:11,504 --> 01:38:13,881
<i>Did he offer you employment then?</i>

1299
01:38:14,632 --> 01:38:15,549
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

1300
01:38:17,009 --> 01:38:20,721
<i>He wanted me to take out
a political rival exiled in the uk.</i>

1301
01:38:23,057 --> 01:38:24,517
<i>- I refused.
- Why?</i>

1302
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:26,936
<i>Because while I was
there, he ordered his men</i>

1303
01:38:27,019 --> 01:38:29,146
<i>to slaughter a village outside polotsk.</i>

1304
01:38:32,233 --> 01:38:33,984
I'm not down with killing innocent people.

1305
01:38:34,318 --> 01:38:36,195
And do you have evidence
to corroborate this?

1306
01:38:36,779 --> 01:38:37,696
Yeah.

1307
01:38:39,448 --> 01:38:42,368
Go to ftp site raven 257.

1308
01:38:44,119 --> 01:38:45,162
Just load it up.

1309
01:38:46,163 --> 01:38:47,289
Exhibit 18-d.

1310
01:38:47,373 --> 01:38:48,916
We've confirmed the coordinates.

1311
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:50,709
It's asking for a password.

1312
01:38:51,293 --> 01:38:52,962
Sorry. Password...

1313
01:38:53,045 --> 01:38:55,089
"Dukhovich is a dick," all caps,

1314
01:38:55,631 --> 01:38:57,258
except "dick" is lower case.

1315
01:39:00,261 --> 01:39:02,096
I wasn't gonna trust
interpol with this shit.

1316
01:39:14,024 --> 01:39:15,025
Order!

1317
01:39:19,113 --> 01:39:20,531
'L]Udge] Order!
{Bangs gavel]

1318
01:39:25,661 --> 01:39:26,620
Order in the court!

1319
01:39:28,038 --> 01:39:28,998
Your honors,

1320
01:39:30,249 --> 01:39:34,587
I could save us all some time.
May I address the court?

1321
01:39:38,257 --> 01:39:41,343
For months, I have been
sitting in this chair,

1322
01:39:41,427 --> 01:39:46,307
nodding along to this ludicrous charade.

1323
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:47,308
Excuse me.

1324
01:39:47,766 --> 01:39:49,226
My excellent attorney
was hoping

1325
01:39:49,310 --> 01:39:51,395
for the legitimacy of a formal acquittal,

1326
01:39:51,478 --> 01:39:53,480
but that is no longer possible.

1327
01:39:53,564 --> 01:39:54,690
Thank you, Darius.

1328
01:39:56,025 --> 01:39:58,861
So, let us now end the charade.

1329
01:39:59,528 --> 01:40:01,530
The charges against me

1330
01:40:02,865 --> 01:40:04,366
are entirely correct.

1331
01:40:06,076 --> 01:40:09,580
I am the rightful ruler of Belarus!

1332
01:40:10,205 --> 01:40:13,083
- Sit down! Order!
- As the ruler of my nation,

1333
01:40:13,167 --> 01:40:16,587
I will do as I wish without exception,
without apology.

1334
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:19,048
- Sit down! Order!
- I recognize no authority

1335
01:40:19,131 --> 01:40:21,258
-that limits my power!
- Mr. dukhovich, I order you...

1336
01:40:24,428 --> 01:40:25,471
Assistant director.

1337
01:40:25,554 --> 01:40:26,847
Go do your job, Amelia!

1338
01:40:28,766 --> 01:40:30,643
In this trial...

1339
01:40:30,726 --> 01:40:34,480
The world community
is attempting to make a statement!

1340
01:40:34,563 --> 01:40:37,858
Well, now I would like to make
a statement of my own!

1341
01:40:43,197 --> 01:40:44,198
Show me your phone.

1342
01:40:48,118 --> 01:40:51,914
I recognize no authority
that limits my powers!

1343
01:41:04,134 --> 01:41:05,678
Everybody go!

1344
01:41:11,684 --> 01:41:15,729
I will now take my leave
with my dignity intact!

1345
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:44,842
Now, that's what
i call triple-a service.

1346
01:41:45,801 --> 01:41:46,719
Fuck!

1347
01:41:48,303 --> 01:41:51,598
Fuck! Medic! Medic!
I need a medic over here!

1348
01:41:52,516 --> 01:41:54,309
- Lockdown protocol!
- Don't move!

1349
01:42:06,155 --> 01:42:09,700
<i>We're here live in front
of the icc in the hague</i>

1350
01:42:10,033 --> 01:42:13,996
<i>where a truck bomb has just plowed
into a crowd of protesters.</i>

1351
01:42:14,705 --> 01:42:16,999
<i>Emergency!
It's a critical health situation!</i>

1352
01:42:17,374 --> 01:42:19,460
<i>We need immediate air and ground support!</i>

1353
01:42:22,546 --> 01:42:23,714
Focus on me, Bryce.

1354
01:42:23,964 --> 01:42:25,424
Bryce! Focus on me.

1355
01:42:25,507 --> 01:42:27,384
I'd really rather not.

1356
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:32,598
<i>...in effect.
All units. All units.</i>

1357
01:42:33,474 --> 01:42:36,351
Stay with me, Bryce. Stay with me.

1358
01:42:36,769 --> 01:42:38,896
I did my job. You go do yours.

1359
01:42:39,688 --> 01:42:41,523
Gotta go get that motherfucker!

1360
01:42:45,694 --> 01:42:46,862
Freeze! On your knees.

1361
01:42:56,955 --> 01:43:00,834
<i>...tower, airmed one requests

<i>to restricted zone bravo

1363
01:43:02,920 --> 01:43:04,797
Officer, the building is in lockdown.

1364
01:43:05,297 --> 01:43:06,673
Dukhovich does not leave his cell.

1365
01:43:12,805 --> 01:43:13,722
Let's go!

1366
01:43:31,824 --> 01:43:33,367
It's over, assistant director.

1367
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:34,868
Give up.

1368
01:44:15,826 --> 01:44:19,371
I didn't want to do this, Amelia.
I swear to you.

1369
01:44:19,997 --> 01:44:21,164
Igunshofl

1370
01:44:48,817 --> 01:44:49,776
fuck!

1371
01:44:58,368 --> 01:45:01,538
Michael! Michael!

1372
01:45:04,249 --> 01:45:07,169
- Michael, you hear me?
- Are you okay? Yeah?

1373
01:45:07,252 --> 01:45:09,046
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

1374
01:45:09,129 --> 01:45:10,130
- You?
- Yeah.

1375
01:45:10,547 --> 01:45:12,716
Oh, no. You're bleeding.

1376
01:45:12,799 --> 01:45:15,177
Oh, no, no, no.

1377
01:45:19,681 --> 01:45:20,599
I'll get some help.

1378
01:45:22,517 --> 01:45:23,435
Stay here.

1379
01:45:34,154 --> 01:45:35,072
Hey!

1380
01:45:35,447 --> 01:45:36,573
Hey!

1381
01:46:07,646 --> 01:46:09,189
Up on the ledge, dookie man.

1382
01:46:12,734 --> 01:46:15,445
You heard me, bitch! Up on the ledge!

1383
01:46:31,795 --> 01:46:33,630
The look on your face.

1384
01:46:35,924 --> 01:46:37,509
You're so proud.

1385
01:46:38,218 --> 01:46:40,220
Darius Kincaid,

1386
01:46:41,138 --> 01:46:43,849
about to be a hero, save the day.

1387
01:46:44,850 --> 01:46:46,351
None of that matters.

1388
01:46:47,352 --> 01:46:48,562
There is no redemption,

1389
01:46:49,021 --> 01:46:52,065
no atonement for a man like you.

1390
01:46:52,149 --> 01:46:56,778
Your whole life has been
but a trail of corpses,

1391
01:46:58,113 --> 01:47:01,241
and I will be just another
dead body on the pile!

1392
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:04,578
Go ahead!

1393
01:47:06,246 --> 01:47:07,164
Finish me!

1394
01:47:09,207 --> 01:47:13,628
But don't think for a moment
it will change what you are.

1395
01:47:21,136 --> 01:47:23,221
I don't give a fuck about all of that!

1396
01:47:24,139 --> 01:47:25,098
You fucked up

1397
01:47:26,099 --> 01:47:29,311
when you shot my bodyguard.

1398
01:47:30,812 --> 01:47:31,730
Who?

1399
01:47:45,577 --> 01:47:46,661
Dukhovich.

1400
01:47:48,663 --> 01:47:49,498
That's dukhovich.

1401
01:48:14,731 --> 01:48:16,900
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

1402
01:48:17,901 --> 01:48:18,944
Celebrity security.

1403
01:48:19,611 --> 01:48:20,529
It's low stress.

1404
01:48:21,154 --> 01:48:23,115
Boy bands and shit, right?

1405
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:25,826
One of those guys gets killed,
nobody's getting all that mad at me.

1406
01:48:27,369 --> 01:48:28,912
Well, we'll figure it out.

1407
01:48:28,995 --> 01:48:29,913
We will?

1408
01:48:31,456 --> 01:48:35,043
Yo! What a brother gotta do
to get arrested up in this bitch?

1409
01:48:37,587 --> 01:48:41,007
Can't someone just taser him?
I mean, like, a non-lethal taser.

1410
01:48:41,383 --> 01:48:45,011
Director casoria. My deal still good?

1411
01:48:45,595 --> 01:48:48,098
You definitely held up
your end, Mr. Kincaid.

1412
01:48:48,765 --> 01:48:53,019
Agent roussel, why don't you go find
Mr. Kincaid some handcuffs.

1413
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:55,230
With pleasure.

1414
01:48:59,609 --> 01:49:01,862
You were right to trust your instincts.
Well done.

1415
01:49:02,946 --> 01:49:03,864
Thank you, ma'am.

1416
01:49:06,575 --> 01:49:08,118
- You're welcome.
- For what?

1417
01:49:08,660 --> 01:49:10,787
I got you a front row seat
to the roussel show,

1418
01:49:10,871 --> 01:49:13,248
and I got you that all-access
backstage pass

1419
01:49:13,331 --> 01:49:15,584
-to that ass you've been wanting so bad.
- You did what?

1420
01:49:15,959 --> 01:49:18,295
You jumped out of the car,
i gave her the 411 on you.

1421
01:49:18,378 --> 01:49:21,298
I didn't jump out of the--
i went through the fucking windshield.

1422
01:49:21,381 --> 01:49:22,215
Semantics.

1423
01:49:22,299 --> 01:49:23,216
Semantics?

1424
01:49:23,300 --> 01:49:25,594
Semantics. Yeah, just another way
of saying the same thing...

1425
01:49:25,677 --> 01:49:27,220
I know what semantics means.

1426
01:49:27,304 --> 01:49:29,222
I also know that I don't need
love advice from you.

1427
01:49:29,306 --> 01:49:31,224
Oh, really? So tell me
how that love life shit

1428
01:49:31,308 --> 01:49:32,434
was going before I showed up.

1429
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:39,316
You know, she's gonna be
right back, and that's it.

1430
01:49:40,442 --> 01:49:41,484
Last chance to run.

1431
01:49:41,985 --> 01:49:44,070
I'm going along with
the program till Sonia's free.

1432
01:49:44,905 --> 01:49:45,947
Then I do my thing.

1433
01:49:47,073 --> 01:49:49,618
You really think
it's gonna be that easy, do you?

1434
01:49:49,701 --> 01:49:50,619
Motherfucker, please.

1435
01:49:50,702 --> 01:49:52,746
You know when I want
some shit to pop, it pops.

1436
01:49:52,996 --> 01:49:55,040
Like that shot
through that tittie-small window

1437
01:49:55,123 --> 01:49:56,208
-on kurosawa's plane.
- That's enough.

1438
01:49:56,291 --> 01:49:58,793
- Okay, that's enough out of you.
- Show me the face you made

1439
01:49:58,877 --> 01:50:00,503
- when that shit went down.
- That still stings.

1440
01:50:00,587 --> 01:50:02,380
I know you wasn't
expecting that shit to happen.

1441
01:50:02,464 --> 01:50:03,798
Yeah, I was expecting you

1442
01:50:03,882 --> 01:50:05,634
to blow my client's head off.

1443
01:50:05,717 --> 01:50:08,094
Did you have that home <i>alone</i>
face thingy, like...

1444
01:50:08,178 --> 01:50:11,139
Do you guys have handcuffs?
Do you have any?

1445
01:50:17,562 --> 01:50:19,940
<i>A worldwide
red notice was issued today</i>

1446
01:50:20,023 --> 01:50:22,025

Oh, baby...

1452
01:50:53,515 --> 01:50:55,183
It's so romantic

1453
01:50:55,267 --> 01:50:57,978
that you broke out of prison
for our anniversary.

1454
01:50:58,061 --> 01:51:01,022
No way was I gonna miss it
this year, corazén.

Hold the roll, please.

1480
01:57:41,005 --> 01:57:42,715
Sorry, Ryan.
Just waiting on church bells, mate.
